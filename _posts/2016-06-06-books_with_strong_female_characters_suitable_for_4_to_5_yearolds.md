A couple of weeks ago I wrote a rant on facebook where I asked for
recommendations for "books with strong female characters which are
suitable for 4 to 5 yearolds. Characters who can think for themselves.
And get shit done. Without a prince. Or without trying to impress a
prince."

I got loads of great suggestions from my friends:
