During the academic year 2010-2011, I did a computer science MSc at
Imperial (which I thoroughly enjoyed). During the last 3 months of the
course, each student does an "individual project". Mine was on
"Disaggregating Smart Meter Readings using Device Signatures" and [the
PDF is now available on the Imperial
website](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/computing/teaching/pg/pg-distinguished-projects)
(note that my birth name is "Daniel" although I've had the nickname
"Jack" since I was 11!)

This MSc project formed the basis for my PhD (I'm doing my PhD with the
same excellent supervisor with whome I did my MSc project). 4 months
into my PhD, I now recognise that my MSc project was pretty naive but it
was lots of fun!<!--break-->
