Back in 2012, a few of us hacker folks chipped away at
[reverse-engineering the radio protocols for Current Cost and EDF
EcoManager electricity
meters](http://jack-kelly.com/current_cost_and_edf_ecomanager_rf_protocols_almost_fully).
We kept our notes on [a github
wiki](https://github.com/JackKelly/rfm_edf_ecomanager/wiki). Then
[Current Cost asked us to take those docs
down](http://jack-kelly.com/deleted_current_cost_protocol_documents_updated_docs_are_back).
But, today, Current Cost very kindly allowed us to put the docs back
online! Specifically, these two docs are now back online:

-   [Technical details of Current Cost RF
    protocol](https://github.com/JackKelly/rfm_edf_ecomanager/wiki/Technical-details-of-Current-Cost-RF-protocol)
-   [Technical details of the EDF EcoManager and
    accessories](https://github.com/JackKelly/rfm_edf_ecomanager/wiki/Technical-details-of-the-EDF-EcoManager-and-accessories)

Have fun :)
