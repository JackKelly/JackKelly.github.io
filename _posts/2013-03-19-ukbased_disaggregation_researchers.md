Are you based in the UK and working on some aspect of smart meter
disaggregation (Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring / NILM / NIALM)? If so,
please get in touch (either leave a comment at the bottom of this blog
post or [contact me directly](http://jack-kelly.com/contact)). I was
speaking to [Oli Parsons](http://blog.oliverparson.co.uk/) and he came
up with the great idea that we should have a UK disaggregation meetup!
