If you're a researcher working on electricity disaggregation (aka NALM /
NILM / NIALM) then would you find a wiki and/or online community useful?

Background
----------

I'm currently doing a Ph.D. on "smart meter disaggregation". I'm in a
lovely and very supportive department and research group but no one else
in my university is doing disaggregation so I find myself having to
spend time gathering information which I'm sure all disaggregation
researchers have to gather. This feels rather inefficient. And I'm not
alone: my understanding is that many disaggregation researchers find
themselves in situations where they are the only ones working on
disaggregation in their institution. Instead of working in these
isolated little "islands of disaggregation", wouldn't it be better if we
had a wiki and/or online community where we could pool our knowledge?
This might allow new researchers to get to the "meaty" work as quickly
as possible; and would allow seasoned researchers to efficiently keep
abreast of developments.

Wiki
----

Some things we could use the wiki for:

-   Detailed descriptions of appliance power consumption. Each appliance
    “article” would have several plots of the appliance waveform (from
    different datasets), describe each power state, histograms of
    appliance usage over an average day etc. Highlight differences
    between different datasets (e.g. US washing machines look nothing
    like UK washing machines).
-   List of conferences, workshops, summer schools and journals suitable
    for NALM researchers
-   Table of research. Each row would have fields such as "sample rate",
    "measured parameters (active power / reactive power / voltage)",
    "classifier (HMM / NN / SVM / KNN / DT etc)". The main purpose would
    be to make it easier to quickly find, for example, "all recent NALM
    research on \*1Hz active power data".
-   Table of NALM competitions and winners.
-   List of data collection hardware
-   Software resources (NALM code, lists of HMM toolkits etc)
-   List of energy recommendation projects
-   Proposed metadata ontology for energy data
-   List of NALM blogs
-   Table of public datasets. For each dataset, have fields for "DOI
    of paper(s) describing dataset", "duration", "sample rate",
    "measured parameters", "number of houses" etc etc

### Software for running the wiki

In terms of software for running the wiki, I'm currently thinking along
the lines of [MediaWiki](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki) (the
software which runs WikiPedia) with the [Semantic Media
Wiki](http://semantic-mediawiki.org/) extension (and others).

Online community
----------------

As well as a wiki, it might also be useful to have an "online
community". This could be as simple as an email list or a Google Plus
community,

-   interesting new papers (including our own ;) ). An online
    “reading group”.
-   technical questions (e.g. "I've noticed *something odd* in *dataset
    X*; has anyone else had this problem?")
-   Decide on a metadata ontology for energy data? (UKERC EDC have one
    but it lacks things like sample rate (different for appliances
    and mains) etc)
-   debating techniques ("I think *my favourite machine learning
    approach* is a great choice for disaggregation. Why hasn't anyone
    used it for disaggregation yet?")
-   Scoping out BSc / MSc / PhD (e.g. “I want to propose an MSc project
    where the aim is to write an open-source implementation of the
    entirety of Hart’s work. Has anyone done this already?”)
-   companies / labs looking for collaborators / internships / employees
    in disaggregation
-   shamelessly linking to our own blog entries on disaggregation ;)
-   announcements of disaggregation competitions (I wrote some notes
    about NALM competitions on [Oli’s
    Blog](http://blog.oliverparson.co.uk/2013/11/belkin-energy-disaggregation.html))
-   announcing / organising NALM workshops / conferences / meetups etc

It takes a while to start communities
-------------------------------------

Of course, it necessarily takes a while for any wiki / online community
to "warm up" and reach critical mass. I'm entirely expecting to be the
only one posting content to the wiki for a while! That's fine (although
it'd be awesome if it wasn't the case!)

My detailed (but scruffy) notes about the wiki and online community are
in [this Google
doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yRHB0dNx6ONjo9YL-8i3JJB9RPd32VFqcat9GQJvmbU/pub).

Specific questions!
-------------------

Some questions that it would be really good to discuss in the
comments...

(Please see [this google
doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yRHB0dNx6ONjo9YL-8i3JJB9RPd32VFqcat9GQJvmbU/pub)
for existing responses to some of these questions)

-   would you find a wiki useful?
-   what about an online community?
-   domain name for the wiki and/or community?
-   software for running the wiki? (Semantic Media Wiki? Drupal?
    Something else?)
-   platform for the online community? (Google Groups? Google Plus
    Community? Self-hosted mailing list e.g. GNU Mailman? Self-hosted
    web forum on the same domain as the wiki?)
-   ideas for content / content structure?
