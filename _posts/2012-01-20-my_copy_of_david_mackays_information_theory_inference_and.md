My copy of [David MacKay](http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/mackay/)'s
book "[Information Theory, Inference and Learning
Algorithms](http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/mackay/itila/)" arrived
yesterday and I started reading it last night. It looks absolutely
fascinating.

I first came across Professor MacKay when I read his other book,
"[Sustainable Energy Without the Hot
Air](http://www.withouthotair.com/)" and  I was struck by how lucid,
readable and entertaining it is. There is every reason to expect that
his information theory book will be at least as readable.

Why get a book on "Information Theory, Inference and Learning
Algorithms"? The main reason is because it should be very useful for my
PhD in smart meter disaggregation. One of the god-fathers of
disaggregation, [George Hart](http://www.georgehart.com/), wrote the
following in [Hart
1992](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=192069):

> It is insightful to consider the \[disaggregation problem\] in the
> context of a communication model. Appliances can be thought of as
> “transmitters”, inadvertently broadcasting information as a by-product
> of their operation. The communication “channel” here is the house
> wiring. Any of the many signatures... may be the “codes” used in this
> communication scheme. Our task is to design a “receiver” for these
> codes which can decode them in terms of appliance state-change
> “messages”.

In other words, the disaggregation problem can be considered in an
information-theoretic framework. This conceptual step allows us to take
advantage of the tools developed in communication technology (i.e.
[coding theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_theory)).

Also, for a while now I've thought of information theory as one of those
"sexy but mysterious" things which I'd love to learn more about. I read
"[Decoding Reality: The Universe as Quantum
Information](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Decoding-Reality-Universe-Quantum-Information/dp/0199237697/ref=pd_sim_sbs_b_2)"
a couple of years ago and found it fascinating (although I only
understood about half the content of the book).

So, hopefully MacKay's information theory book will be a great
self-study book.<!--break-->
