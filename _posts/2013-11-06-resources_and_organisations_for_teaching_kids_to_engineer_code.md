other resources to mention!

Hardware & Software
-------------------

-   [Lego Big
    Blocks](http://shop.lego.com/en-GB/LEGO-Large-Brick-Box-6166) - the
    classic! Our 2 1/2 yearold daughter loves these. You can build
    simple animals, towers, houses etc.
-   Boxes for building towers - I forget the brand name but our daughter
    has a box of boxes(!) that she loves. It's just a set of about 10
    colourful boxes; each one a little smaller than the previous one
    such that they all pack away into the largest box (a little like a
    Russian doll). It's great for building towers. Surprisingly good
    fun!
-   [TED Talk: AnnMarie Thomas: Hands-on science with squishy
    circuits](http://www.ted.com/talks/annmarie_thomas_squishy_circuits.html)
-   [Little Bits](http://littlebits.cc/) - little electronics building
    blocks which snap together with magnets.
-   adafruit have a [Young
    Engineers](http://www.adafruit.com/category/117) section of their
    shop (including Little Bits)
-   [Snap Circuits](http://www.snapcircuits.net/)

    Wires](http://www.johnadams.co.uk/retail/action_science/Hot_Wires/)
-   [Cambridge BrainBox Electronics
    Kits](http://www.cambridgebrainbox.com/Primary-Plus2.html) -
    several kits. Similar to Hot Wires and Snap Circuits.
-   [Superstructs Starter
    Set](http://www.amazon.co.uk/WABA-Fun-403-SUPERSTRUCTS-STARTER/dp/B000A12YK8/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8&qid=1375260593&sr=8-10&keywords=superstructs+big+builder) -
    We bought this for our 2 1/4 yearold. I was hoping that it would be
    easy to assemble the pieces but it's actually quite physically tough
    to force some of the pieces together (even for an adult!). You often
    have to apply quite a lot of pressure and must do so within quite a
    narrow range of angles. As such, I'd hesitate to recommend these for
    younger kids. But, that said, our daughter does like this kit, even
    though she can't get many of the parts to connect together. She can
    build simple little creations and she often demands "Mummy / Daddy,
    build new car!" Of course, the toy is meant for 3 year olds upwards,
    so I'm being a little unfair writing a review based on our 2 1/4
    yearold's experiences! It's entirely possible that a patient 3 year
    old would be able to assemble the pieces with little trouble.

    (we bought the "construction starter set" for our 2
    yearold daughter. She likes fiddling with it although it'll be a
    while before she can build anything substantial with it. But she
    loves asking me and her mum to build robots for her! At 26 months
    she's just about getting the hang of putting a nut on a bolt and
    taking it off again, although she still needs a lot of help
    with that.)

Specific building projects
--------------------------

-   Build dens out of scrap cardboard boxes, wrapping paper,
    bottles etc. The kids draw where they want windows and adults cut
    out the windows for them. Use plastic tube 'telephones' between
    the dens. Use simple electronics (batteries, switches, lights, door
    bells etc).
-   [Doodlebot](http://thebedroomlaboratory.com/running-your-own-doodlebot-workshop/)
-   [Marshmallow
    Challenge](http://marshmallowchallenge.com/Welcome.html) - build the
    largest structure out of spaghetti (or thin bits of wood?) and
    marshmallows (or blue-tack?)
-   Use syringes and pipe to make simple pneumatics, to add to
    constructions made of cardboard etc
-   stop-frame animation (lego, plasticine, real people etc!)
-   'use this cardboard and junk to make a space rocket'. Maybe put up
    poster-size images of real space rockets (or use a projector).
-   build cranes from syringes, rulers etc.
-   make plasticine conduct

Academic Papers

-   Bers et al. [Computational thinking and tinkering: Exploration of an
    early childhood robotics
    curriculum](http://ase.tufts.edu/devtech/publications/computersandeducation.pdf).
    *Computers & Education*. **2014**.
    DOI:[10.1016/j.compedu.2013.10.020](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2013.10.020).
    Abstract: "*By engaging in construction-based robotics activities,
    children as young as four can play to learn a range of concepts. The
    TangibleK Robotics Program paired developmentally appropriate
    computer programming and robotics tools with a constructionist
    curriculum designed to engage kindergarten children in learning
    computational thinking, robotics, programming, and problem-solving.
    This paper documents three kindergarten classrooms’ exposure to
    computer programming concepts and explores learning outcomes.
    Results point to strengths of the curriculum and areas where further
    redesign of the curriculum and technologies would be appropriate.
    Overall, the study demonstrates that kindergartners were both
    interested in and able to learn many aspects of robotics,
    programming, and computational thinking with the TangibleK
    curriculum design.*"

    DOI:[10.1016/j.compedu.2011.10.006](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2011.10.006).
    Abstract: "*This study reviews recently published scientific
    literature on the use of robotics in schools, in order to: (a)
    identify the potential contribution of the incorporation of robotics
    as educational tool in schools, (b) present a synthesis of the
    available empirical evidence on the educational effectiveness of
    robotics as an educational tool in schools, and (c) define future
    research perspectives concerning educational robotics. After
    systematically searching online bibliographic databases, ten
    relevant articles were located and included in the study. For each
    article, we analyze the purpose of the study, the content to be
    taught with the aid of robotics, the type of robot used, the
    research method used, and the sample characteristics (sample size,
    age range of students and/or level of education) and the
    results observed. The articles reviewed suggest that educational
    robotics usually acts as an element that enhances learning, however,
    this is not always the case, as there are studies that have reported
    situations in which there was no improvement in learning. The
    outcomes of the literature review are discussed in terms of their
    implications for future research, and can provide useful guidance
    for educators, practitioners and researchers in the area.*"

    devices have been used in educational settings for many years for
    robotics, environmental sensing, scientific experimentation, and
    interactive art. Based on a historical analysis of the development
    of these devices, this study examines the design principles
    underlying the several available platforms for physical computing
    and presents a framework to analyze various platforms and their use
    in education. Given the now widespread use of these devices among
    children and their long history in the field, a historical review
