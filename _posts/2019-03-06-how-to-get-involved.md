So, you've read [my](/blog/2019-01-07-non-profit) [ramblings](/blog/2019-01-09-update) on building a non-profit called Open Climate Fix, entirely focused on using open-science to help fix climate change ASAP, and you'd like to help.  That's great!

First, a quick disclaimer: OCF is still very, _very_ young.  We don't yet have funding, a website, a bank account, or a Slack workspace.  (These things will come!)  I'm spending the majority of my time meeting people (I've had over 100 meetings over the last 7 weeks, and plenty more planned - I'm trying hard to focus on meetings relevant to solar PV now).  So, please be patient with me!  Once I actually start writing code and releasing data, then there will be much more for folks to get stuck into.

In the mean time, here are a few ideas for how to help!

* Please take a look at our list of [Solar data & software](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tk9cF4O539TzaMaUufn9Ay4f6qKKEyoNKmzP03kbSDo/edit?usp=sharing) and add any resources that you can find!  e.g. we'd love help locating more sources of satellite data of cloud cover.
* Take a look at the [Solar Projects](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14UZd_qdAjD8P1VGNQThf3rZz9tBCXk2_ySZ_oNIEdSs/edit?usp=sharing) doc.  Please comment on any projects that you'd like to help with.  Heck, if you want, please go right ahead and take the lead on any of those projects :)  For example, one great stand-alone project would be to build a simple website to allow people to enter the location of PV panels into Open Street Map.  (Please comment on the doc if you do go ahead and start work on a project, so we don't duplicate work.)
  * The Solar Projects doc includes some 'research' sections.  These sections contain lists of ideas for self-contained research projects, many of which don't require any coding (just spending some time googling stuff and/or contacting people).  We'd people to take on these research projects!
* If you have PV power data, please either email it to me (jack@jack-kelly.com), or upload the power data to [PVOutput.org](https://pvoutput.org/).
* Please help with [openclimatefix.org](http://openclimatefix.org) website!  ([Code is on GitHub](https://github.com/openclimatefix/openclimatefix.github.io/)).  Feel free to submit pull requests for small changes.  For big changes, please describe your proposal in [the issue queue](https://github.com/openclimatefix/openclimatefix.github.io/issues) before you start coding, just to make sure no one else is already working on something similar!
* Do you work at an organisation with solar PV power timeseries data or PV location data or satellite imagery?  (e.g. an inverter company, or a solar analytics company)?  Or do you know someone who does?!  If so, _please_ get in touch.  I'm very hungry for good PV data!
* Map the geographical location of PV systems in [Open Street Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org), using [tag:generator:source=solar](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:generator:source=solar).
* If you know about cloud forecasting / aerosol forecasting / determining the toplogy of the electricity network / related things then please email me!
* Erm... it's always awkward talking about money but, um, if you are into climate philanthropy - or if you know of anyone who's into climate philanthropy - then please email me!  My intention is that Open Climate Fix will reduce emissions by millions of tonnes (at least), at a cost of a few dollars per tonne.  (i.e. considerably cheaper than most other interventions).
