My family is _finally_ getting over whooping cough. It has been a very bumpy ride.

The aim of this blog post is to try to explain the ways in which our experience of whooping cough differed from the "textbook" description of whooping cough. And I'll very cautiously offer some advice for folks who think they may have whooping cough. But I must emphasise that I'm _not_ a medical doctor! Please take my advice with a massive pinch of salt, and make sure you see a real doctor!

## What is whooping cough

Whooping cough (sometimes called the "100-day cough") is caused by a bacterial infection in the lungs. The whooping cough bacterium is called Bordetella pertussis. It is highly contagious (until the patient has cleared the bacterial infection). [In England and Wales, whooping cough is a "notifiable disease"](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pertussis-clinical-and-public-health-management).

Luckily, Bordetella pertussis can be killed with [macrolide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrolide) antibiotics. (Well, if we're being pedantic: macrolides are [bacteriostatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriostatic_agent), so macrolides don't actually _kill_ bacteria, instead macrolides stop bacteria from reproducing.) Macrolide antibiotics include azithromycin, erythromycin and clarithromycin (note that the names of all macrolide antibiotics end in "mycin").

Note that penicillins don't have much (if any) effect against whooping cough. This is a really important point. If you go to a UK GP complaining of a chest infection then the first antibiotics the GP will reach for will probably be amoxicillin (a penicillin) which won't help with whooping cough. If you go back to the GP complaining that your symptoms haven't improved (despite finishing your course of amoxicillin) then the GP may infer that you have a _viral_ infection, or nasal drip (we received both of these misdiagnoses).

For more info, see [the wikipedia page on whooping cough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whooping_cough).

### Why does Bordetella pertussis make you cough?

Whooping cough usually has three distinct phases: 1) the catarrhal phase (where the symptoms are very similar to having a "normal" cough), 2) the paroxysmal phase (where you get intense coughing fits), and 3) the convalescent phase (where you have cleared the bacteria from your body, but your cough lingers for weeks or months, and slowly gets better).

[Here's an interesting 2022 paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9239215/) discussing some evidence that sheds light on why the bacteria causes a cough. (And, interestingly, this paper also makes the point that one reason that we don't know much about coughs is that, until very recently, we thought there were no good animal models for coughs. In particular, it was thought that mice don't cough. But, recently, it's been found that mice _do_ cough, just very quietly!)

The short answer is that evolution is very clever: The Bordetella perussis bacteria excretes toxins into your lungs which sensitise your lungs to coughing (so you start coughing more frequently), and also disrupt the signalling pathway that would usually _stop_ a cough (so you get coughing _fits_). Supposedly, this helps the bacteria to spread to other hosts! And, supposedly, the effects of these toxins linger after the bacteria have gone.

## What was whooping cough like for our family?

In short: This has been the worst "cold" I've ever experienced. This has been _way_ worse for our family than covid. (We've had covid at least twice; and we've had all our covid jabs. And I thought covid was bad!). (Although, of course, I appreciate that covid can be far worse for other people!)

My 12 yearold daughter was the first in our family to start coughing. I started coughing about two weeks after my daughter.

For my daughter and I, our symptoms started as a fairly mild cough, with no other symptoms (the "catarrhal" phase). But, about a week after starting coughing, we both started having severe coughing fits several times per day (the "paroxysmal" phase), and generally feeling really ill. These fits are no joke. These coughing fits completely take over your body for about a minute. It can feel impossible to breath. The only thing that stops you panicking that you'll never breath again is knowing that you've had many of these fits before, and they eventually subside. You wake several times a night, already in a coughing fit, fighting for breath. When fighting for breath between coughs, both my daughter and I made "whooping" sounds. We both had low blood oxygenation saturation (about 94%). Even once the fit subsides, my daughter and I both still felt light-headed and found it hard to breath for another minute or so after the cough, as if the cough had tightened up our lungs.

There were some differences between my daughter's symptoms and my symptoms. My daughter's coughing fits would make her vomit about once a day. So much so that she lost 3 kg of weight over the 8 week course of her cough. My daughter also had a temperature, which would come and go. At worst, her temperature got to about 38.4 â„ƒ.

I didn't vomit, nor did I have a temperature. But I did pass out about 4 times during a coughing fit. And I pulled a muscle in my back from coughing so hard. And, towards the end of my whooping cough, my lungs made a worrying "crackling" sound on most breaths (as if there was sticky mucus throughout my lungs).

After a few weeks of coughing, your ribs really ache when you cough.

In general, whooping cough is a very "physical" illness. The coughing fits are very violent. For me, whooping cough was like my worst bout of covid (where I was exhausted for 3 weeks) PLUS really violent coughing fits PLUS the fact that whooping cough can last for months. Whooping cough isn't like any other cough or cold I've ever had because whooping cough really _hurts_. You don't just feel horribly ill. You also spend a lot of time in physical pain.

My daughter and I also had periods of several weeks of just feeling really ill: very low energy, just wanting to stay in bed all day. Even a 15 minute walk felt like a huge challenge.

My daughter and I also experienced a weird effect where, about half way through the course of the infection, we had a few days where it really felt like we were getting better (possibly due to antibiotics). Only for it suddenly to get even worse.

In total, my daughter was ill for over 8 weeks. I was ill for about 4 weeks.

My kids were both vaccinated against whooping cough when they were younger. But immunity wanes after several years.

My 10 yearold son and my wife both also caught coughs (a few weeks after my cough started). My son had the least symptoms (which I'd guess is because he's most recently had his whooping cough vaccine). My son just had a slightly annoying cough for about 10 days. No other symptoms. My wife had an annoying cough for a few weeks, with no other symptoms. Neither my son nor my wife got full-blown coughing fits. Neither my wife nor my son needed to see a doctor (so they didn't get any meds).

## What did the doctor say? Which medications did we get?

I have a huge amount of respect for doctors. They work under enormous stress. All the doctors we saw were _lovely_, and attentive, and we always got a GP appointment within a day or two of requesting one. My criticisms below are entirely aimed at the health _system_, not at any individual doctors!

I won't go into every detail of our interactions with the health service.

When my daughter started getting serious coughing fits (including "whooping" during coughing fits), my wife and I suspected whooping cough. Whooping cough had been in the news. And, as far as we could tell, our daughter's symptoms exactly matched the "textbook" symptoms for whooping cough.

But, for at least the first 3 weeks of our daughter's cough, no doctor would entertain the idea that she had whooping cough. Despite my wife and I asking politely but increasingly firmly about whooping cough. In the first 6 weeks of her cough, our daughter was given 4 different courses of antibiotics (3 penicillins and 1 macrolide. In order, she had: amoxicillin, clarithromycin, co-amoxiclav, and back to amoxicillin. In retrospect, she did get quite a bit better after the clarithromycin. But I guess the clarithromycin didn't completely kill the bacteria.).

To be fair to the doctors, the doctors said that they were seeing a _lot_ of coughs at the time. One doctor said that every second patient was complaining of a cough. And, in the first week or two of whooping cough, whooping cough looks very similar to other coughs.

When I started getting coughing fits, I saw a doctor 3 times, over several weeks. I wasn't given a macrolide antibiotic. The first doctor gave me amoxiccilin. The second doctor said I had nasal drip and didn't give me any antibiotics, but did give me a steroid nasal spray (which made things worse). The third doctor thought I probably had a viral infection (because the amoxicilin hadn't had any effect on my symptoms), but still gave me co-amoxiclav (which didn't fix the whooping cough but did upset my stomach a lot). (I did eventually obtain azithromycin, which seemed to work very well... more on that later...) 

In general I was disappointed that for the first 7 weeks of my daughter's cough she wasn't offered a single lab test. Neither was I. Despite us asking for lab tests. (Again, to be fair to the doctors, I assume this is because lab tests cost money, and lots of people have coughs, so it would cost a lot of money to test every person who complains of a cough. But, still, in 2024, I'm amazed that we're not testing every serious cough. Although my expectations are way too high... When I first started researching tests for whooping cough, I actually expected that, in 2024, it would be routine to sequence the DNA of every organism found in your spit or blood! (Spoiler: that's definitely _not_ what happens!))

Eventually, after 8 weeks of coughing, and still having indications of an active infection (raised pulse rate, tired, temperature) my daughter was sent to A+E. The A+E doctor strongly suspected whooping cough. Although, very worryingly for us, it was also possible that our daughter had TB or sepsis! So we finally got a bunch of lab tests for whooping cough. Her blood tests showed a strong positive result for whooping cough antibodies, and her blood tests showed multiple markers of an _active_ bacterial infection (and this is 8 weeks after she started coughing!). Her tests were negative for all the respiratory viruses they tested for, and negative for TB (phew!). The A+E doctor prescribed azithromycin. Which appeared to clear up the bulk of her symptoms within a few days.

To be honest, we don't know for _sure_ that _I_ had whooping cough (because I didn't get any lab tests). But I had very similar symptoms to my daughter, and I almost certainly caught my cough from my daughter, and it appears that azithromycin finally cleared my infection.

## How our experience of whooping cough differs from the "textbook"

The [NHS web page on whooping cough](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/whooping-cough/) says "_If you've had whooping cough for more than 3 weeks, you're no longer contagious and do not need antibiotics._". The experience of my daughter and I suggests that both of these statements are wrong.

After 8 weeks of coughing, my daughter was getting _worse_, and still had an active bacterial infection. Then she was given azithromycin. And the bulk of her symptoms went away within a few days. Azithromycin helped her after 8 weeks.

I had a horrible cough for 4 weeks. I still felt really ill after 4 weeks (which is evidence - albeit _weak_ evidence - that I still had an active infection after 4 weeks). And then I started on azithromycin. And I felt better within a few days.

Perhaps this is just coincidence. Perhaps we were already getting better (without the azithromycin). And, of course, this is all anecdotal, and not done under "lab conditions".

The "textbook" says that serum (antibody) testing isn't appropriate for ages 17 or younger. But a whooping cough serum test came back strongly positive for my 12 yearold daughter.

## Advice for people who think they may have whooping cough

Again, to repeat what I said at the beginning: I'm not a medical doctor! Please see a real doctor!

As far as I can tell, one of the big challenges with whooping cough is that the _only_ way to know for sure that you have whooping cough is to get a lab test. Whooping cough symptoms (especially in the first week or two) are too similar to other coughs to identify whooping cough from symptoms alone. Chest x-ray might show a non-specific lung infection but, as far as I know, x-ray can't definitively tell you that you have whooping cough (unlike, for example, advanced TB, which can have very distinctive appearance on chest x-ray).

If you suspect that you have whooping cough then ask politely but  firmly for a lab test for whooping cough. See [the NICE web page on whooping cough for details of the available tests](https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/whooping-cough/diagnosis/confirmation-of-diagnosis/). Note in particular that you don't need to cough up phlegm to be tested for whooping cough (one doctor we saw said that we couldn't be tested for whooping cough because neither I nor my daughter could cough up phlegm from our lungs on demand). Some whooping cough tests can be done on swabs or blood samples. Also note that the cheapest test - growing bacteria in a culture - is not very sensitive to whooping cough, and takes 3 to 7 days to get a result. [Lee et al. 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5898745/) say that cultures are 64% sensitive for whooping cough. [Lauria & Zabbo 2022](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK519008/#_article-27057_s7_) say that cultures are only 20 - 40% sensitive for whooping cough! And that sensitivity is highly dependent on the quality of the sample. Which makes sense: for a culture test to be positive, you have to extract sufficient _living_ bacteria from the patient, and those bacteria have to survive being transported. In contrast, PCR is 90% sensitive and doesn't require living bacteria ([Lee et al. 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5898745/)).

If you think you have whooping cough, but your GP prescribes a penicillin antibiotic, then maybe gently ask whether it's possible to swap to a macrolide antibiotic. (Even if the doctor suspects some other bacterial infection, macrolides are still effective against community acquired pneumonia ([Kyprianou et al. 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857923002212)). My daughter and I had no side effects from azithromycin.)

If you start on a macrolide antibiotic as early into whooping cough as possible (ideally within a few weeks of starting to cough), then it may be possible to avoid at least some of the pain, and you can limit the number of people you transmit whooping cough onto.

If your GP refuses to test you, and if you're lucky enough to be able to afford it, then you can pay for whooping cough tests (e.g. Blood London can perform a [whooping cough PCR test](https://www.blood.london/test/whooping-cough-pertussis-by-pcr/) (which tests for an active infection) and a [whooping cough antibody test](https://www.blood.london/test/whooping-cough-pertussis-antibodies/). But note that a "standard" (not specific to whooping cough) sputum culture test isn't at all sensitive to whooping cough, because the [whooping cough bacteria are very fussy about the medium that they grow on](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK519008/#_article-27057_s7_)!

If you're comfortable reading slightly technical medical literature then definitely read the [Pertussis page on the NIH website](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK519008/). It's the best single article I've found on whooping cough.

## Random trivia (not _at all_ related to the rest of this blog post. Honest.)

Some UK pharmacists sell chlamydia treatment online. In the UK, azithromycin is used as a _second line_ treatment for chlamydia.

Please please _please_ don't abuse this! Antibiotic-resistance in bacteria is a very serious problem (go and read about the horrible effects of drug resistant TB). And you can cause yourself serious damage by taking too many antibiotics and/or the wrong antibiotics. And you should only take antibiotics prescribed by your doctor.

## The official figures for UK whooping cough infections are almost certainly an under-estimate

In England and Wales, [whooping cough is a "notifiable disease"](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pertussis-clinical-and-public-health-management). Which means that, in theory, the UK Health Security Agency should be informed of _every_ whooping cough infection.

In our household, it's quite likely (although not certain) that all four of us had whooping cough. Yet, as far as the UK HSA are concerned, only one of us has had whooping cough, because only my daughter has had a positive lab test result. And, if my daughter had gotten better within 6 weeks then _no one_ in our household would have appeared in UK HSA's statistics.

My concern is that there's a feedback loop here: Whooping cough is perceived as being rare. So - being good [Bayesians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_statistics) - doctors are reluctant diagnose whooping cough, and reluctant to order whooping cough tests. And, if the doctor _does_ order a test, then they might order a culture, which is shocking insensitive to whooping cough (see above). So lots of whooping cough is very likely being misdiagnosed (e.g. as a viral cough, or nasal drip, or pneumonia). So the UK HSA is only being informed of a tiny fraction of the UK's whooping cough cases. So the UK HSA statistics show that whooping cough is rare. So doctors continue to perceive whooping cough as rare, and are reluctant to diagnose whooping cough, and reluctant to order tests. And so the cycle goes on...

## Why are cases of whooping cough increasing?

Anti-vaxxers carry a lot of the responsibility. See: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-68990222

(It makes me feel physically sick that misinformation in the virtual world has caused real, material harm to my family, and to my friends).
