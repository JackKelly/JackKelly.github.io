My little family is _finally_ getting over whooping cough. It's been a very bumpy ride.

The aim of this blog post is to try to explain the ways in which our experience of whooping cough differed from the "textbook" description of whooping cough. And I'll very cautiously offer some advice for folks who think they have whooping cough. But I must emphasise that I'm _not_ a medical doctor! Please take my advice with a massive pinch of salt, and make sure you see a "real" doctor!

## What is whooping cough

Whooping cough (sometimes called the "100-day cough") is caused by a bacterial infection in the lungs by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. It is highly contagious (until the patient has cleared the bacterial infection). [In England and Wales, whooping cough is a "notifiable disease"](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pertussis-clinical-and-public-health-management).

If whooping cough is diagnosed early (within a few weeks) then it can be treated with a macrolide antibiotic (which include include azithromycin, erythromycin and clarithromycin). Note that penicillins don't have much (if any) effect against whooping cough.

For more info, see [the wikipedia page on whooping cough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whooping_cough).

The cough is likely to continue for a while (weeks or months) after the body has cleared the bacteria. [Here's an interesting 2022 paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9239215/) on why that is. (And, interestingly, it turns out that one reason that we don't know much about coughs is that, until very recently, we thought there was no good animal model for coughs. In particular, it was thought that mice don't cough. But, recently, it's been found that mice _do_ cough, just very quietly!)

## What was whooping cough like for our family?

In short: This has been the worse "cold" I've ever experienced. This has been _way_ worse for our family than our experience of covid. (And we've had covid at least twice). (Although, of course, I appreciate that covid can be far worse for other people!)

My 12 yearold daughter was the first to start coughing. I started coughing about two weeks after my daughter.

For my daughter and I, our whooping cough started as a fairly mild cough, with no other symptoms. But, about a week after starting coughing, we both started having severe coughing fits several times per day, and generally feeling really ill. These fits are no joke. These coughing fits completely take over your body for about a minute. It can feel impossible to breath. The only thing that stops you completely panicking that you'll never breath again is knowing that you've had many of these fits before, and they will eventually subside. You wake several times a night, already in a coughing fit, fighting for breath. When fighting for breath between coughs, both my daughter and I made "whooping" sounds.

There were some differences between my daughter's symptoms and my symptoms. My daughter's coughing fits would make her vomit about once a day. So much so that she lost 3 kg of weight over the 8 week course of the cough. My daughter also had a temperature, which would come and go. At worse, her temperature got to about 38.4 â„ƒ..

I didn't vomit, nor did I have a temperature. But I did pass out about 4 times during a coughing fit. And I pulled a muscle in my back from coughing so hard. And, towards the end of my whooping cough, my lungs made a worrying "crackling" sound on most breaths (as if there was sticky mucus throughout my lungs).

After a few weeks of coughing, your ribs really ache when you cough.

My daughter and I also had periods of several weeks of just feeling really ill: very low energy, just wanting to stay in bed all day. Even a 15 minute walk felt like a huge challenge.

My daughter and I also experienced a weird effect where, about half way through whooping cough, we had a few days where it really felt like we were getting better. Only for it suddenly to get even worse.

In total, my daughter was ill for over 8 weeks. I was ill for about 4 weeks.

My kids were both vaccinated against whooping cough when they were younger. But immunity wanes after several years.

My 10 yearold son and my wife both also caught coughs. My son had the least symptoms (which I'd guess is because he's most recently had his vaccine). My son just had a slightly annoying cough for about 10 days. No other symptoms. My wife had an annoying cough for a few weeks, with no other symptoms. Neither my son nor my wife got full-blown coughing fits. Neither my wife nor my son needed to see a doctor (so they didn't get any meds).

## What did the doctor say? Which medications did we get?

I have a huge amount of respect for doctors. They work under enormous stress.

I won't go into every detail of our interactions with the health service.

When my daughter started getting serious coughing fits (including "whooping" during coughing fits), my wife and I suspected whooping cough. Whooping cough had been in the news. And, as far as we could tell, our daughter's symptoms exactly matched the "textbook" symptoms for whooping cough.

But, for at least the first 3 weeks of our daughter's cough, no doctor would even entertain the idea that she had whooping cough. Despite my wife and I asking politely but increasingly firmly about whooping cough. In the first 6 weeks of her cough, our daughter was given 5 different courses of antibiotics (4 penicillins: amoxicillin and co-amoxiclav, and 1 macrolide: clarithromycin).

To be fair to the doctors, the doctors said that they were seeing a _lot_ of coughs at the time. One doctor said that every second patient was complaining of a cough. And, in the first week or two, whooping cough looks very similar to other coughs.

And, also to be fair to the doctors, they were all _lovely_, and attentive, and we always got a GP appointment within a day or two of requesting one.

When I started getting coughing fits, I saw a doctor 3 times, over several weeks. I wasn't given a macrolide antibiotic. (I did eventually obtain a macrolide, which seemed to work very well... more on that later...) 

In general I was disappointed that for the first 7 weeks of my daughter's cough she wasn't offered a single lab test. Neither was I. Despite us asking for lab tests. (Again, to be fair to the doctors, I assume this is because lab tests cost money, and lots of people have coughs, so it would cost a lot of money to test every person who complains of a cough. But, still, in 2024, I'm amazed that we're not testing every serious cough. Although my expectations are way too high... I actually expected that, in 2024, it would be routine to sequence the DNA of every organism found in your spit or blood. But apparently we're still looking at bacteria under a microscope.).

Eventually, after 8 weeks of coughing, my daughter was sent to A+E. The A+E doctor strongly suspected whooping cough. So we finally got a bunch of lab tests for whooping cough. Her blood tests showed a strong positive result for whooping cough antibodies, and her blood tests showed multiple markers of an active bacterial infection (and this is 8 weeks after she started coughing!). Her tests were negative for all the respiratory viruses they tested for. The A+E doctor prescribed azithromycin. Which appeared to clear up the bulk of the symptoms within a few days.

To be honest, we don't know for _sure_ that I had whooping cough (because I didn't get any lab tests). But I had very similar symptoms to my daughter, and I almost certainly caught my cough from my daughter.

## How our experience of whooping cough differs from the "textbook"

The "textbook" says that antibiotics are useless after 3 weeks.

My daughter was getting _worse_ at 8 weeks. Then she was given azithromycin. And the bulk of her symptoms went away within a few days.

I had a horrible cough for 4 weeks. And then I started on azithromycin. And I felt better within a few days.

Perhaps this is just coincidence. Perhaps we were already getting better (without the azithromycin).

The "testbook" says that serum (antibody) testing isn't appropriate for ages 17 or younger. But a whooping cough serum test came back strongly positive for my 12 yearold daughter.

## Advice for people who think they may have whooping cough

Again, to repeat what I said at the beginning: I'm not a medical doctor! I really can't give medical advice.

If you suspect that you have whooping cough then ask politely but very firmly for a lab test for whooping cough. If you start on a macrolide antibiotic within a few weeks of starting to cough, then you can avoid at least some of the pain, and you can limit the number of people you transmit whooping cough onto.

If your GP refuses to test you, and if you're lucky enough to be able to afford it, then you can pay for whooping cough tests (e.g. Blood London can perform a [whooping cough PCR test](https://www.blood.london/test/whooping-cough-pertussis-by-pcr/) (which tests for an active infection) and a [whooping cough antibody test](https://www.blood.london/test/whooping-cough-pertussis-antibodies/). But note that a standard sputum test (which grows the sputum bacteria in a medium) won't find whooping cough, because the whooping cough bacteria are very fussy about the medium that they grow on!

## Random trivia (not _at all_ related to the rest of this blog post. Honest.): You can buy azithromycin online in the UK.

Please please _please_ don't abuse this! Antibiotic-resistance in bacteria is a very serious problem. And you can cause yourself serious damage by taking too many antibiotics.

In the UK, azithromycin is used as a _second line_ treatment for chlamydia. And some online UK pharmacists sell chlamydia treatment (if you fill in a short web form).
