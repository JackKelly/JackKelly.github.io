Just a very quick note to say I'm a week into [Stanford's free online
Probabilistic Graphical Models
course](https://www.coursera.org/pgm/class).  It's really, *really* good
and I'm learning loads (although does require a fair amount of work). 
The online course covers the same content as Stanford's postgraduate PGM
course (it's not watered down like Stanford's free online Machine
Learning course) and has interesting programming assignments.  Very
juicy stuff and it should substantially improve my ability to refine and
implement some of my hand-wavy ideas.

This is the first on-line course I've taken and I'm very impressed.  It
seems to be a near-perfect mix of the best bits from "real" lectures and
the best bits from studying alone with a text book.  i.e. it's engaging
and "human" like a lecture; but you also have the option to pause /
rewind (like reading a text book) to think things through.<!--break-->
