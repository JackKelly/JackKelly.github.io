I've started [a wiki page for technical details of the EDF EcoManager
protocol](https://github.com/JackKelly/rfm_edf_ecomanager/wiki/Technical-details-of-the-EDF-EcoManager-and-accessories).
Please feel free to edit!

### UPDATE 30/10/2012

Current Cost have asked me to remove the protocol documentation from the
wiki. More details [here](/deleted_current_cost_protocol_documents).

### UPDATE 5/1/2016

Current cost have kindly allowed me to put the docs back onto [the
github wiki](https://github.com/JackKelly/rfm_edf_ecomanager/wiki/)!
