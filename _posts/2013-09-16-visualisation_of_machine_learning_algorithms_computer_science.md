Here's another computer science group project that I have submitted for
consideration by students this coming year. As always, comments are very
welcome!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Algorithms used in machine learning can often feel quite complex when
you first come across them. As you gain experience with the algorithm
you begin to be able to visualise each step and then realise that the
algorithm is actually quite intuitive. Wouldn't it have been far easier
to learn the algorithm if you had seen a good visualisation of the
algorithm to begin with!

For example, here's a visualisation of selection sort ([taken from
WikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Selection-Sort-Animation.gif)):

The aim of this project is to produce interactive, animated
visualisations of a set of machine learning algorithms. (Don't worry if
you don't know any machine learning algorithms yet; this project would
be a good opportunity to gain intimate knowledge of a few algorithms).

Below are some suggestions to get your ideas flowing.<!--break--> These
really are just suggestions, you do not *have* to do any of these
things. The design of the interface and the algorithm selection will be
up to you!

-   Implement the interface as a web application using modern tools like
    [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) and
    [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svg). Building a web application
    (rather than, say, a downloadable Java application) will not only
    make your system really easy for desktop users to access, but will
    also allow alternative platforms to access your visualisations (e.g.
    iPad and Android) . You could use [the JavaScript library
    D3.js](http://d3js.org/) to help to build your visualisations.

-   As well as visualising the *effect* of the algorithm, also display a
    simple outline of *how* the algorithm works (perhaps using pseudo
    code or a [control flow
    graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow_graph)) and
    highlight which step of the algorithm is being executed at each time
    step in the visualisation. You could also animate the flow of
    information through the control flow graph. Below are some generic
    control flow graphs (from
    [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow_graph)).

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/Simplified_Control_Flowgraphs.jpg)

-   As well as (or instead of) visualising *general* machine learning
    algorithms, you could visualise *specific* systems from distant or
    recent history. For example, you could visualise code breaking
    algorithms like those developed by [Alan
    Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) and colleagues at
    [Bletchley Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bletchley_Park)
    during the Second World War to
    [crack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptanalysis_of_the_Enigma)
    codes generated by the [Enigma
    Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine). Or [IBM Deep
    Blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Deep_Blue)'s chess
    playing system. Or [bleeding edge speech recognition systems which
    use deep neural networks and hidden Markov
    models](http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/171498/HintonDengYuEtAl-SPM2012.pdf).
    Whatever takes your fancy.

Here's a (simplified) wiring diagram of the [Engima
machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine) ([taken from
WikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Enigma_wiring_kleur.svg)):

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Enigma_wiring_kleur.svg/424px-Enigma_wiring_kleur.svg.png)

-   If you can make your visualisations easy to "play" with then you're
    onto a winner. e.g. if you visualise computer vision algorithm then
    allow the user to draw their own input images; perhaps allow users
    explore the details of the algorithm by clicking on the control flow
    graph to get more details of each step; perhaps even allow users to
    disconnect edges in the control flow graph to see the effect of
    breaking the algorithm in different ways.

-   As well as building interactive visualisations, it would be useful
    to create simple, stripped-down animations for inclusion on the
    WikiPedia page for each algorithm.

-   It would be nice to open source the project when you're done, but
    that's up to you.

-   In terms of which machine learning algorithms to visualise,
    algorithms which function on [probabilistic graphical
    models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_model) might be
    especially ripe for visualisation (because graphical models are, by
    their nature, easy to visualise). Things like:

    -   the [Viterbi
        algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbi_algorithm)
        ([here's an existing
        visualisation](http://veeresht.info/blog/viterbi-algorithm-illustrated/)),
    -   [Markov chain Monte
        Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo)
        (including some subclasses of MCMC like [Gibbs
        sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_sampling) and some
        motivating examples of MCMC like [simulating Ising
        models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model#Monte_Carlo_Methods_for_Numerical_Simulation))
    -   the [Expectation
        Maximisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation%E2%80%93maximization_algorithm)
        algorithm for learning parameters in a [hidden Markov
        model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model).
