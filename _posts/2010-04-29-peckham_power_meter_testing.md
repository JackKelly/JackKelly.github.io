Peckham Power [are currently developing a Power Meter
project](/power-meter-project).  Anna and Hugo have been testing the kit
and now it's my turn.  We're testing the [AlertMe
meter](http://www.alertme.com/).  There are two main components: a small
device which clamps (non-invasively) to the cable coming into the house
and a base station which wirelessly communicates with the clamp and
connects to the broadband modem.  The data is sent to AlertMe and then
to [Google Power Meter](http://www.google.com/powermeter/about/) which
allows you to analyse your consumption and figure out where you can save
energy and money.
