 We took the train to Whitstable for a gorgeous day away from work.

If we'd have driven in our Ford Focus 1.8 (which really isn't very
efficient... not my choice of car) then we would have emitted 36kg
CO~2 ~

The stats:

-   Car:
    -   60 miles each way; 120 miles total
    -   The car averages about 35mpg (measured; total occupancy = 2
        humans, 1 dog)
    -   Total fuel consumed = 3.4 gallons = 15.5 litres
    -   Cost of fuel (at £1.20 per litre) = £18.60
    -   Total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from vehicle exhaust = 36kg
        ([ref](http://www.nef.org.uk/greencompany/co2calculator.htm))
    -   Journey time per direction = about 1hr 10mins
    -   Pros:
        -   Convenient (especially when taking any luggage like dog
            food, towels etc)
        -   Faster than train
        -   Cheaper (if you only consider fuel cost and ignore cost of
            vehicle, tax, repairs, insurance)
    -   Cons:
        -   Higher CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
        -   Driver can't read / look out the window
        -   Driving can't be described as relaxing
        -   Dog gets car sick!
-   Train:
    -   Cost of 2 return tickets from Peckham to Whitstable (bought on
        the day) = £42
    -   Total emissions = 5-22kg
        CO<sub>2</sub> ([ref](http://directgov.transportdirect.info/Web2/JourneyPlanning/JourneyEmissionsCompare.aspx?repeatingloop=Y) 1,
        [ref
        2](http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/sustainable/book/tex/cft.pdf))
        (depends on loads of variables including train occupancy, energy
        source, speed of train etc).
    -   Travel time (per direction) = about 2 hours
    -   Pros:
        -   about a third of the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
        -   relaxing (as long as you travel off peak) - you can read /
            chat / eat / look out the window
        -   our dog likes trains ;)
    -   Cons:
        -   More expensive (if you book on the day)
        -   Takes slightly longer
        -   Can't take much luggage
