These are just some quick notes where I aim to list all the wireless kit
in our home and the frequency on which they operate, so I can be
confident that the 433MHz packets I'm seeing are from Current Cost kit.

-   Gigaset AL180 cordless phones. Complies with DECT ([1800-1900MHz in
    Europe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Enhanced_Cordless_Telecommunications#Technical_properties))
-   Altech wireless thermostats: 868MHz
-   WiFi: 2.4GHz
-   2G mobile network: 900Mhz and 1800MHz. 3G: 1900MHz and 2100MHz.
