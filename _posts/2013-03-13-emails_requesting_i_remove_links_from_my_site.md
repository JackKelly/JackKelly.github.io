Over the past few months, I have received three emails along the lines
of this one:

> It has come to our attention that your site may be linking to our own
> in a manner which we believe may be mutually harmful in SEO terms. For
> this reason, I would be very grateful if you would please remove all
> links to this site at your earliest convenience, letting me know that
> you have done so.

If you run a blog, have you received similar emails? My standard reply
is along these lines:

> I am happy to remove the link to &lt;company name&gt; from my site if
> necessary. However, before I do that...
>
> (Forgive me for being paranoid and ultra-sceptical but...)
>
> How do I know that you're not working for a competitor to &lt;company
> name&gt; who is trying to decrease the ranking of &lt;company name&gt;
> on search engines? I see that your email address comes from the domain
> &lt;company name.suffix&gt; but we all know that it's trivial to fake
> the "from" address of an email.

> Please can you confirm that if I was to contact &lt;company name&gt;
> directly then they would confirm that you are working for them?

Following my reply, all three people who have contacted me have, so far
at least, gone quiet.
