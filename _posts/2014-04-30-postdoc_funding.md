I'm probably still a year or so away from finishing my PhD but I've
started to explore funding opportunities for UK computer science post
doctoral researchers. (I think I'd really quite like to continue working
on energy disaggregation after my PhD; there are still lots of research
problems; and we're a very long way from having a robust, open source
disaggregation tool for end-users).

Imperial have a ['funding opportunities' web
site](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/research-and-innovation/funding-opportunities/).

Knowledge Transfer Partnership
==============================

-   <http://www.imperial-consultants.co.uk/clients/smes/funding>
-   <http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/enterprise/corporatepartnerships>

Royal Society
=============

-   [full list of grant schemes provided by the Royal
    Society](https://royalsociety.org/grants/schemes/)
-   The following are probably most relevant to me:
    -   [University Research
        Fellowship](https://royalsociety.org/grants/schemes/university-research) -
        "must have between 3 to 8 years of research experience since
        their PhD by the closing date"
    -   [Industry
        Fellowship](https://royalsociety.org/grants/schemes/industry-fellowship)
        "For academic scientists who want to work on a collaborative
        project with industry and for scientists in industry who want to
        work on a collaborative project with an
        academic organisation.... The applicant must have a PhD"
    -   [Brian Mercer Feasibility
        Award](https://royalsociety.org/grants/schemes/brian-mercer-feasibility):
        "For scientists who wish to investigate the feasibility of
        commercialising an aspect of their research."
    -   [Brian Mercer Award for
        Innovation](https://royalsociety.org/grants/schemes/brian-mercer-innovation):
        For scientists who wish to develop an already proven concept or
        prototype into a near-market product, ready for commercial
        exploitation

EPSRC
=====

[EPSRC Doctoral
Prize](https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/skills/students/dta/doctoralprize/)

The EPSRC have a new
[Fellowships](http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/skills/fellows/Pages/fellowships.aspx)
structure.

-   "Applications can be submitted at any time and will be processed on
    a rolling basis. Fellowship applications will be prioritised twice a
    year in approximately January/February and July, at our
    standard-grant panel meetings."
-   "There is no outline stage in the new Fellowship process. Applicants
    are required to submit a full proposal."
-   The [Energy
    Fellowship](http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/skills/fellows/Pages/energy.aspx)
    sounds especially relevant: "This embraces energy efficiency
    measures, reduction in demand for energy, and reduction in demand
    for energy services / mobility - all of which will contribute to
    reducing carbon emissions from energy use. It includes research
    extending from the built environment to industrial processes and
    products, from materials to design and from markets and regulation
    to organisational and individual behaviour. Fellows should be
    engaged in multidisciplinary research embracing engineering
    (including ICT), social science (behaviour, practices,
    policies, economics) and involve any sector (buildings, transport,
    whole systems, industry)."

Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851
===========================================

-   [Research Fellowships](http://www.royalcommission1851.org/awards/).
    "The call for applications will be in October, with a closing date
    of 18 February 2016... Candidates must be in possession of a recent
    PhD, or equivalent qualification (normally with no more than 3 years
    postdoctoral experience) or be in the final stages of their PhD
    studies, which must be successfully completed before the award of a
    Fellowship can be confirmed."

EU Horizon 2020
===============

This isn't a post-doc funding source as such... it's more for doing
collaborative research projects across multiple EU member states (MS)...

I did a quick bit of reading about the Horizon 2020 EU fund. I think the
two that are most relevant to energy disaggregation are:

-   [EE-11-2014: New ICT-based solutions for energy
    efficiency (RIA)](http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/topics/2063-ee-11-2014.html#tab1),
    1.5 to 2M€ per project. Deadline = 5th June 2014
-   EE-11-2015: New ICT-based solutions for energy efficiency (RIA), 1.5
    to 2M€per project. Deadline = 10th June 2015

I think "RIA" stands for "Research and Innovation Actions" which means
"activities aiming to establish new knowledge and/or to explore the
feasibility of a new or improved technology, product, process, service
or solution. For this purpose projects may include basic and applied
research, technology development and integration, testing and validation
on a small-scale prototype in a laboratory or simulated environment.
Standard eligibility conditions: three legal independent entities from
different MSs or ACs. Funding rate: 100%"
