Back in February, we insulated the two bedrooms in our end-of-terrace
Victorian solid-walled house. This blog post attempts to document the
process, including lots of photos. The detailed plans for this project
(including some CO<sub>2</sub> calculations and a complete shopping list) are
described in [a previous blog
post](/planning_to_insulate_bedrooms_this_weekend). A quick re-cap of
the plans:

-   Our upstairs walls are not damp so we can just attach the insulation
    directly to the plastered wall, we didn't bother with
    wooden battens.
-   Use Fermacell instead of plasterboard. Fermacell is *much* stronger
    than plasterboard, so it should be possible to hang shelves directly
    from the Fermacell.
-   65mm insulation + 12.5mm Fermacell
-   Use 160mm "frame-fixing" screws to mechanically secure the Fermacell
    to the brick. These come with their own wall plugs. To use, just
    drill straight through the Fermacell + insulation + brick, then
    hammer the wall plugs into place and screw in the long screws (i.e.
    you don't need to pre-drill the wall and then try to align holes in
    the insulation with holes in the wall).

In total it took about three weekends to install the insulation for both
our bedrooms, MUCH less time than it took [to insulate our living
room](http://jack-kelly.com/insulating_our_victorian_living_room). (This
time does not include the time taken to plaster and decorate, which we
had done by some excellent local decorators - I just installed the
insulation & Fermacell.)

On to the details...

The insulation waiting to be installed:

I tried two different permutations. In our daughter's bedroom, I first
attached the the 65mm celotex insulation to the wall (using expandable
foam and long nails), then cut the Fermcell to size and secured the
Fermcell to the brick using frame fixings.

In the photo below, two sheets of insulation are attached (the far right
sheet of insulation is behind the Fermacell sheet which is temporarily
leaning against the insulation). I applied the expanding foam in a grid
to try to minimise the chance of any air being able to convect in big
loops behind the insulation.

<span class="flickr-wrap" style="width:640px;"><span
class="flickr-image">[![DSCF1497.jpg](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8060/8203112680_4cfb8b2b12_z.jpg "DSCF1497.jpg")](https://www.flickr.com/photos/37816297@N06/8203112680)</span></span>

And I added some expandable foam to the edge of the insulation to the
gaps between each insulation sheet is as airtight as possible:

<span class="flickr-wrap" style="width:480px;"><span
class="flickr-image">[![DSCF1499.jpg](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8338/8202021233_b569253760_z.jpg "DSCF1499.jpg")](https://www.flickr.com/photos/37816297@N06/8202021233)</span></span>

Attaching the insulation before attaching the Fermacell gave me the
opportunity to tape over the gaps in the insulation to create a vapour
barrier. This probably isn't necessary though:

<span class="flickr-wrap" style="width:640px;"><span
class="flickr-image">[![DSCF1500.jpg](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8069/8203113368_33a392d205_z.jpg "DSCF1500.jpg")](https://www.flickr.com/photos/37816297@N06/8203113368)</span></span>

Here's the insulation and Fermacell fully installed in our daughter's
room:

<span class="flickr-wrap" style="width:640px;"><span
class="flickr-image">[![DSCF1501.jpg](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8066/8202021857_aaf91f7356_z.jpg "DSCF1501.jpg")](https://www.flickr.com/photos/37816297@N06/8202021857)</span></span>

In our main bedroom, I tried a different method. I tried to make my own
laminates of insulation and Fermacell by glueing the Fermacell to the
insulation before cutting:

Here's the glue applied to the insulation just before the Fermacell is
about to be attached:

<span class="flickr-wrap" style="width:640px;"><span
class="flickr-image">[![DSCF1509.jpg](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8337/8202026219_f254da9f6c_z.jpg "DSCF1509.jpg")](https://www.flickr.com/photos/37816297@N06/8202026219)</span></span>

And here's the laminate drying (I put three sandbags onto the laminate
to make sure the Fermacell is pushed onto the insulation).

<span class="flickr-wrap" style="width:640px;"><span
class="flickr-image">[![DSCF1504.jpg](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8340/8203115184_e72b34653f_z.jpg "DSCF1504.jpg")](https://www.flickr.com/photos/37816297@N06/8203115184)</span></span>

Attaching the insulation to the Fermcell prior to cutting has the
advantage that you only have to cut and attach to the wall once. But it
does take a while to glue the sheets. And you need a lot of glue! Oh,
and the glue sinks out the house for a good day.

**Just to emphasise: all the glue used in this project is just to
temporarily hold components in place while I'm working. All the
mechanical strength comes from the frame fixing screws.**

Fermacell is very tough stuff so I hired a jigsaw from HSS to help me
cut the shapes for the windows:

Here's the "window wall" in our main bedroom (prior to insulation):

Woops, a frame fixing screw sheered while being screwed into place!

I used the special Fermacell "jointstick" sealant between the boards
(which sets remarkably solid). We used a local plasterer to skim over
the boards. It is possible to get a good finish completely DIY but our
walls are so wobbly and my work so rubbish that we decided it would be
best to get a professional skim finish!

Tips:

-   2.4 x 1.2m Fermcell sheets are *very* heavy. My wife and I really
    struggled to move the sheets upstairs. I just about managed to
    install the sheets myself but only by "walking" the sheets across
    small distances. If you're going to install Fermcell yourself then
    it might be better to get 1200x600mm sheets.
-   Our walls are terrible. Usually about one in every two holes I
    drilled was too crumbly to support a frame fixing. I got into the
    habit of pushing a thin wooden chopstick into the hole prior to
    hammering the wall plugs in. This seemed to slightly increase the
    chance of the wall plug "gripping".
-   Expandable foam very quickly loses its stickiness (maybe
    10 minutes?) so you have to be very quick if you're going to use
    expandable foam in the same way I did.
