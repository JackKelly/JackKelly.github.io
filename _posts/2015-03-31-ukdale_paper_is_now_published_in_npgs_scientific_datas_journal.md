Nature Publishing Group has a new(ish) journal called [Scientific
Data](http://www.nature.com/sdata). Today Scientific Data published our
paper "[The UK-DALE dataset, domestic appliance-level electricity demand
and whole-house demand from five UK
homes](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2015.7)". And, a few days ago,
our dataset received the first data DOI from the [UK Energy Research
Council's Energy Data Centre](http://ukedc.rl.ac.uk/) (UKERC EDC):
DOI:[10.5286/UKERC.EDC.000001](http://dx.doi.org/10.5286/UKERC.EDC.000001).
Hurray ;) Huge thanks to the folks at the UKERC EDC and at Scientific
Data. Further details of the dataset can be found [on my dataset web
page](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~dk3810/data/).
