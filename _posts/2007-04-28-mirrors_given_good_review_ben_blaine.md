Ben Blaine (from Shooting People) has seen MIRRORS and given it what can
only be called a glowing review. Here's a snippet (he talks about
MIRRORS and another short called HOME):

> Both films are about ten minutes long, both are without dialogue, both
> are beautiful to look at it and both deal with loss and grief in
> gorgeous tones of blues and greens. Both also have a compelling sense
> of both mystery and symmetry, though they express this in different
> ways.
