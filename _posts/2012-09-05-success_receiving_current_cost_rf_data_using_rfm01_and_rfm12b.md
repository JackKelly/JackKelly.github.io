At last! Some successes! Yesterday I finally managed to receive Current
Cost RF packets using an RFM01 (the receiver module used on the Current
Cost EnviR) and today I got my RFM12b transciever successfully receiving
packets too! The [RFM01 code is
here](https://github.com/JackKelly/rfm_current_cost) and [the RFM12b
code is here](https://github.com/JackKelly/rfm_edf_ecomanager). The code
is still rather scruffy because I'm still *very much* in the prototyping
stage. I've started attempting to send pings to my new EDF IAM but
haven't succeeded yet. I'll blog with more details soon.
