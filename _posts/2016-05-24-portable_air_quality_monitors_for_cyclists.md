I cycle 14 miles each day in London (7 miles each way). I'm getting
increasingly worried that I'm breathing in lots of bad stuff. I love my
cycle ride into work: It's the best way to get my brain working in the
morning. So I'm not planning to stop cycling. But I would like to figure
out which route into work is least polluted.

So I want a portable air quality monitor. It needs to record data at
regular intervals (every few seconds) so I can sync it up to my phone's
GPS recording later and see which roads are most polluted (or perhaps
the air quality monitor would send data to my phone to be recorded on
the phone along with the GPS track).

The short answer is that I can't find what I want for sale. So I might
hack together my own device. But below are some notes with links to the
sensors that I did find:

-   [Plume Labs](https://www.plumelabs.com/) provide a "plume air
    report" - an "urban weather forecast". Apparently they attached air
    quality sensors to pigeons (hat tip to [@edeverett on
    Twitter](https://twitter.com/edeverett/status/735104832365862912))!
    They don't appear to have any hardware for sale.
-   [Air Quality Egg](http://airqualityegg.com/) "A community-led air
    quality sensing network that gives people a way to participate in
    the conversation about air quality.". Not very portable, as far as I
    can tell.
-   "Researchers at Germany's Karlsruhe Institute of Technology have
    developed a smartphone-connected tool that can sense dust levels,
    which can be an important metric for some public health issues."
    ([from
    MobiHealthNews.com](http://mobihealthnews.com/34856/researchers-develop-smartphone-based-air-quality-tool-for-public-health/))
    Measure PM using phone's camera, I think.
-   [Foobot](http://foobot.io/). PM2.5; tVOC; CO2; CO. Might
    be portable. Might be for sale?
-   [ChemiSensse](http://chemisense.co/) - not portable?
-   [aeroqual](http://www.aeroqual.com/) - make sensors I think
-   [Speck](http://www.gizmag.com/speck-indoor-air-monitor/36575/?li_source=LI&li_medium=default-widget) -
    not portable?
-   [Atmotube](http://www.gizmag.com/atmotube-pollution-monitor-air-quality/40438/?li_source=LI&li_medium=default-widget) -
    only CO and VOC?
-   [Cheap NO2 sensor in
    development](http://www.gizmag.com/nitrogen-dioxide-sensor/40082/)
-   [CleanSpace Tag](https://store.clean.space/) Portable.
    BLE. Freevolt. But only measures CO.
