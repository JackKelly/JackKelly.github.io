Control of cameras for time-lapse photography

### Using PICs

PICs (programmable integrated circuits) to have timers etc so it would
be possible to make a decent time-lapse controller using a PIC but it
would take a lot of effort to programme. Advantages: low cost, lost
power consumption. Disadvantages: would take ages to develop, would only
work with a camera that I'd hacked, would only control one camera, can't
be network-attached, can't control camera settings etc

### Using a laptop
