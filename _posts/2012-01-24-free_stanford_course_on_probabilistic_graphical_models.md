One of the main research directions for my PhD is likely to be
experimenting with bispoke probabilistic graphical models for
representing multi-state appliances like washing machines.  As such, I
need to learn about existing probabilistic graphical models.  For the
past few days I've been reading a textbook called ["Probabilistic
Graphical Models" by Koller and
Friedman](http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&tid=11886). 
So far I've really enjoyed the book.

Over lunch today, a friend of mine told me that [Stanford are running a
free on-line course on Probabilistic Graphical Models, presented by
Koller](http://www.pgm-class.org). I've signed up - it looks like a
great course; it starts in Feb. [Stanford are also running a course on
Information Theory](http://www.infotheory-class.org/), which I've also
signed up for.<!--break-->
