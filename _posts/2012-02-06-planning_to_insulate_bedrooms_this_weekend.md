This weekend my wife and 5-month old daughter are going up North so I'm
going to take the opportunity to insulate our two bedrooms.  The loft is
well insulated (as demonstrated this past weekend by the fact that snow
didn't melt on our roof even though we had the heating on most of the
weekend) but the walls are currently just 9" solid brick (with a
[U-value](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-value_%28insulation%29#U-value)
of 2.1 W<span
style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 19px; ">·</span>m^-2^<span

the "U-value" is simply a measure of how well a building element
conducts heat; a lower value means a better insulator. The [2010
building
regs](http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/buildingregulations/approveddocuments/partl/approved)
specify a U-value of 0.3 W<span
style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 19px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); ">·</span>m^-2^<span

walls). Adding 65mm of [PIR
insulation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyisocyanurate) (with
[thermal
conductivity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conductivity) of
0.022 W<span
style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 19px; ">·</span>m^-1^<span
style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 19px; ">·</span>K^-1^)
should bring the U-value of the wall down to  0.3 W<span
style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 19px; ">·</span>m^-2^<span

(in other words, it should reduce the rate at which the walls lose heat
by a factor of just over seven.  To give a concrete example of what this
implies: say the external temperature is 0°C and the internal
temperature is kept at 18°C then the heat loss in our main bedroom
through the external walls prior to insulation would be 780 W; after
insulation the heat loss will be just 100 W).

By how much will this reduce our energy consumption?  Let's create a
*very* simple model for just the main bedroom to get a feel for the
numbers.  Let's say that, for 50 days of the year, we heat our bedroom
to 18°C all day whilst the external air temperature is 0°C.  Prior to
insulation, the bedroom walls will leak

0.78 kW <span
style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); ">×</span> 24
hours per day <span

days = 940 kWhours per year

after insulation that figure is just 120 kWh per year.  At 8p per kWh
for gas, that's a financial saving of

(940-120) kWh <span
style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px; ">×</span> £0.08
per kWh = 820 kWh <span

per kWh = £65 per year

Given a cost of about £600 for the insulation, dry-wall adhesive, frame
fixing screws, plasterboard socket enclosures etc, that's a pay-back
period of just over 9 years (assuming gas prices stay the same). And the
insulation should decrease the running costs of the house for the
remainder of the house's lifetime (maybe 50 more years?).

It also represents a CO<sub>2</sub> saving of

820 kWh <span
style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px; ">×</span> 0.2
kg CO<sub>2</sub> per kWh of gas = 164 kgCO<sub>2</sub> per year

Which is a bit more CO<sub>2</sub> than a return flight from London to Paris for
one person every year.  If we assume the house lasts for another 50
years (and is heated by gas for 50 years) then that's a saving of 8.2
tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>.

I'm ordering 11 sheets of [Celotex
PL4000](http://www.celotex.co.uk/products/celotex-products/celotex-pl4000)
from
[PlanetInsulation](http://www.planetinsulation.co.uk/store/index.php#Celotex_PL_4000_range__Plasterboard_Backed) (plus
bonding compound, screws etc).  Celotex produced a decent enough ["how
to install" video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WL_iQcO9trk) in Dec
2011.  I'm planning to glue the sheets to the wall and also screw them
in place.  I did [briefly look into options for installing ply wood over
the
insulation](http://www.greenbuildingforum.co.uk/forum114/comments.php?DiscussionID=4845&page=1#Comment_133864)
(to make it easy to put up shelves etc) but it looks like it'll not be
worth the effort.  I also started a discussion on the green building
forum asking "[Best frame fixings for installing insulated
plasterboard?](http://www.greenbuildingforum.co.uk/newforum/comments.php?DiscussionID=8574)".

**update 8th Feb 2012**

After [discussing some more on the Green Building
Forum](http://www.greenbuildingforum.co.uk/forum114/comments.php?DiscussionID=4845&page=1),
I've decided not to use insulated plasterboard because my wife and I
want a wall surface which is easy to attach things to (shelves, pictures
etc).  The problem with insulated plasterboard is that plasterboard
can't take much load, so if you want to attach heavy shelves etc then
you have to somehow get your screws into the brickwork behind the
insulation and plasterboard (the easiest way to do this is with a frame
fixing screw (screwfix do frame fixing screws up to 185mm in length); if
you need to attach really heavy loads to plasterboard then take a look
at[these suggestions
on](http://www.greenbuildingforum.co.uk/forum114/comments.php?DiscussionID=4845&page=1#Comment_133942)GBF).

I considered creating my own laminate consisting of 65mm insulation +
11mm OSB ply + 9.5mm plasterboard.  This costs about £40 per "sandwich".
 I would glue the components together to make it easier to cut and
install.  Ultimately the sandwich would be secured to the wall using
lots of frame fixings (i.e. the glue is just to hold the sandwich
together during installation; but when it's installed the glue can
completely fail if it wants because all the load will be taken by the
frame fixings).  Rather tediously, most OSB is supplied in 2440<span
style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px; text-align: center; ">×</span>1220
dimensions, but I want 2400<span
style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px; text-align: center; ">×</span>1200mm
to match the insulation and plasterboard. I phoned our local building
control officer and she said that this solution should be fine from a
fire regs perspective because the inner layer is plasterboard.

Ultimately I'm planning to go for creating my own laminate of 65mm PIR
insulation + 12.5mm Fermcell instead of messing around with OSB.
 Insulation + Fermacell works out about the same price as
insulation+OSB+PB, is easer to work with, less environmentally damaging
and almost as strong.  Fermcall is considerably more expensive than
plasterboard but is about the same price as plasterboard + OSB.
 Fermacell is apparently pretty heavy stuff so I'm worried I wont be
able to install it on my own but we'll see. It's apparently "easy" for a
DIYer to achieve a good finish using Fermacell Fine Surface Treatment
instead of requiring a wet plaser skim (although a skim is possible if
desired).  There's [lots of discussion of Fermacell on GBF
here](http://www.greenbuildingforum.co.uk/newforum/comments.php?DiscussionID=4655).
 There's [a Fermacell video installation guide
here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4dmofAxwC0&feature=related).  I'll
glue the insulation to the Fermacell using Evo-Stik 528 Industrial
Contact Adhesive and then secure each laminate to the wall with frame
fixings (I'm going to try both "Rawlplug Frame Fixings 10<span
style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px; text-align: center; ">×</span>140mm"
(£19 for 50) and "Fischer Nylon Frame Fixings 10×160mm" (£29 for 50) and
see which I prefer). As with the previous design, the glue is just to
aid installation; it is *not* for mechanical strength (that's what the
frame fixings are for).   The mains bits of the shopping list are now:

    to fill between Fermacell and existing plaster walls
-   [Evo-Stik 528 Industrial Contact Adhesive
    2.5L (£31.19)](http://www.screwfix.com/p/evo-stik-528-industrial-contact-adhesive-2-5ltr/42076) -
    to glue insulation to Fermacell (to aid installation)
-   3 × [Titan Masonry Drill Bit
    10×300mm (£2.84 each)](http://www.screwfix.com/p/titan-masonry-drill-bits-10-x-300mm/34885)
-   Rawlplug Frame Fixings 10×140mm (£19 for 50) - to secure
    insulation+Fermacell to brick
-   Fischer Nylon Frame Fixings 10×160mm (£29 for 50) - to secure
    insulation+Fermacell to brick
-   Dry-lining socket boxes, fire-rated expanding foam, foam gun, foam
    remover, plastic shims etc

The total cost is about £600.

Now to do the building control application... (aren't I a good boy)...

**Update Nov 2012**:

I've finally gotten round to [blogging about the installation process
itself](/insulating_our_bedrooms)!
