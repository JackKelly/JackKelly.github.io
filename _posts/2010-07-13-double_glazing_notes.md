# Final Solution:

We went with [Draught Busters Ltd](http://www.draught-busters.co.uk/) to make and install the
windows.  Great company; very easy to work with. Mel spent a lot of
time helping me to get what we wanted. The final solution was to ask
Draught Busters Ltd to make the frames. If I remember correctly, the
glass we specified was a 24mm unit from UA Glass (see below) with a
center-pane U-Value of 1.1. 

## Specs

We have an end-of-terrace Victorian house in SE15, London; built
around 1905. We're looking to replace a total of 5 windows (which are
uPVC at present) with sash windows (no vertical glazing bar) with the
highest thermal performance we can get, without breaking the bank. The
sizes are:

* Living room bay: 
  - 3 windows, all 1.84m high
  - The side windows are 0.52m wide
  - The middle window is 1.09m wide
* Bedroom:
  - 2 windows
    - both are 1.56m high x 0.97m wide
    
Standard fittings. We'd like the windows to look as much as possible like original wooden
sash windows.   Ideal glass: 

- white warm spacers 
- toughened 
- soft coat 
- gas filled (argon or, better, krypton) 
- low u-value 
- apparently a centre-pane U-value of 1.1 is required for the DGU to get a whole-window U-value of 1.6 when using standard wooden frames
- Need to get a certificate for the whole window if we tell BCO (local joinery company may not be capable of this).

# Suppliers of Double Glazing Units

## Clayton Glass

* http://claytonglass.uk.com/html/softcoat.html

Very helpful. Can deliver to London. 

* 4-10-4 argon planitherm, toughened = U1.5 = £50 / m2 (advised that we can probably get this locally) 
* 4-10-4 kryton filled, soft coat, toughened = U1.1 = £90/m2

## Timbalite

Apparently their slimline product can achieve a u-value of 0.9 with an
overall thickness of just 16mm but it's £204 per square meter!

## Swedish Timber Products Ltd (in York!)

http://www.swedishtimberproducts.co.uk

Very helpful.  They don't do sliding sash but they do some windows which may look in keeping but
it'd be a bit of an experiment. Costs are £350-400 per m2 for
whole-window U-value of 1.3,  Add 40-50% for U=0.8. They would only
provide the windows (plus bits and bobs); we'd have to use a local
builder to install.  103mm front to back. Krypton costs a lot.
Krypton is required to get below 1.0.  Warm edge doesn't add that much
onto the cost.

## Japanese vacuum glazing

There's an interesting article on Building.co.uk about a Japanese
double glazing unit with an overall thickness of 6mm and a U-value of
1.4. It achieves this impressive U-value by maintaining a vacuum between
the two panes of
glass.

##  Pearson Glazing

2 Pennethorne Road, Peckham

(http://pearsonglass.com/index.asp)

Tel: 020 77321511, Email: customerservices@pearsonglass.com
DGU charged at £71.50 m^2, £25 min per unit.


I assume this is for regular glass.
I called 4th May. All she said is that a 24mm
glazing unit in timber frame, argon filled, 4mm float, will "confirm to
building regs" (which means \>=2.0, I think), toughened = £125/m2

## UA Glass, Norwich

Enquiries: mailto:enquiries@uaglass.co.uk

For 4 sealed units 376 x 671, in standard clear pilkington K glass come to £67.78 inc VAT,
for all 4 units (hence, £15 each).

[They can supply DGUs](http://uaglass.co.uk/double-glazed-sealed-units.htm) from 14-28mm
thick (changing the overall thickness just changes the gas-filled gap
between the glass, the thickness of the glass remains the same and hence
the weight remains fairly constant). The wider the gap, the lower the
u-value. A 20mm thick DGU with their highest-performing glass coating
achieves a U-value of 1.4; if you go a bit wider then it goes down to
1.2 (which is incredibly impressive; I was under the impression that to
get below 1.4 you had to move from double to triple glazed, adding
significantly to cost and weight). 20mm = 1.4 W/m2. 

24mm, white spacer available = 1.1 W/m2 = £50 / m2 float, £70 / m2 toughened

No performance increase above 24mm.

If thinner and lighter glass is required then they also do a product called
[SashLite](http://uaglass.co.uk/sashlite-double-glazed-units.htm)
with an overall thickness of 11/12mm and achieves a U-value of 1.6 (3mm
or 4mm Clear / 4mm Krypton Gas Filled Cavity / 4mm Low E; warm edge).

Recommended [on Green Building Forum](http://www.greenbuildingforum.co.uk/newforum/comments.php?DiscussionID=865&Focus=80797#Comment_80802).
Manufacturers very high performance double glazed and tripple glazed units. Many options significantly below a u-value of 1. Also 
[make entire sash windows](http://www.careyglassjoinery.com/winSlidingSash.php) with a
U-value of 0.7-1.4.

Their Elite TGUS have a u-value of 1.1 and
their Elite SE get down to 0.7 for 28mm total thickness

They do have an office in Manchester. 

I called. The Manchester office only deals with large architectural orders of 100s of square meters and
doesn't deal with the full windows (including frames) at all.
