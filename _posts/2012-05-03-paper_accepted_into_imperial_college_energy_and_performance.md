My submission to the [Imperial College Energy and Performance Colloquium
2012](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/icep/) has been accepted. It's just an
extended abstract which briefly outlines some ideas for my PhD research.

The paper is:

-   Kelly J, [Knottenbelt
    W](http://aesop.doc.ic.ac.uk/people/wjk/). **Disaggregating
    Multi-State Appliances from Smart Meter Data. ***Imperial College
    Energy and Performance Colloquium.* 29 May - 1 June 2012.
     [PDF](/files/writing/ICEP_submission.pdf)

**Abstract**:

> Smart electricity meters record the aggregate consumption of an entire
> building.  However, appliance-level information is more useful than
> aggregate data for a variety of purposes including energy management
> and load forecasting. Disaggregation aims to decompose an aggregate
> signal into appliance-by-appliance information.
>
> Existing disaggregation systems tend to perform well for single-state
> appliances like toasters but perform less well for multi-state
> appliances like dish washers and tumble driers.
>
> In this paper, we propose an expressive probabilistic graphical
> modelling framework with two main design aims: 1) to represent and
> disaggregate multi-state appliances and 2) to use as many features
> from the smart meter signal as possible to maximise
> disaggregation performance.
