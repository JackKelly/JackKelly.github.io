Now that I've (finally!) submitted my PhD thesis, I can focus on
designing and implementing a competition for energy disaggregation
algorithms. EDF Energy have kindly given me post-doc funding from now
until the end of December 2016 to work on the NILM competition.

The broad plan is to first consult with the NILM community and create a
specification for the NILM competition which works for everyone. Then I
plan to implement a web application which can run the NILM competition.

Right now, I'm writing [a survey on the design of a competition for
energy disaggregation
algorithms](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSci1GWr44orBpimhOM88GWavppkY8fvJ8-bopc5joGAEye10g/viewform).
The aim of the survey is to systematically collect feedback about the
design of the competition. I plan to launch the survey soon. Prior to
the launch, I'm really eager to hear feedback on the survey itself. For
example: is the survey missing any vital questions? Do some questions
not provide sufficient options? Do some questions not make sense?!

Please note that, prior to the launch of the survey, my aim is to get
feedback on the design of the survey itself. So please don't actually
submit any answers yet! Feel free to select options and click "next" but
just please don't click "submit" at the end of the survey. I'll write
another blog post when the survey is ready to accept answers.

It's probably best to provide feedback about the survey in public on
[the relevant thread on the Energy Disaggregation Google
Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/energy-disaggregation/4I9rHMpkMTY/NVsnrQH1EAAJ).
If you want your feedback to be private then, by all means, email me
directly at jack.kelly@imperial.ac.uk!

And please do get in touch if you have feedback on any aspect of [the
proposed NILM
competition](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CGoiNNkcnAFpo7Lci0Dv7AIliK3xz7Rjq_mBBh0WwrQ/edit?usp=sharing).
