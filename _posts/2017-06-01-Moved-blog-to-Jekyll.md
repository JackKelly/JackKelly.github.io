title: Moved blog from Drupal to Jekyll
---

After using [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) since about 2005, I have moved my blog to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (a static website generator) and [Disqus](https://disqus.com/).  I'm very pleased with Jekyll and Disqus so far.  My new site is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which uses Jekyll natively (Jekyll was started by a GitHub developer).
