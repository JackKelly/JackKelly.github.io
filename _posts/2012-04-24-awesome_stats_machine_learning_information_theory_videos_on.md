I'm still very much enjoying the Coursera / Stanford Probabilistic
Graphical Models course but occassionally I need to turn to another
source to help explain the concepts.  I've just re-descovered
[MathematicalMonk on
YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/user/mathematicalmonk/videos?view=1).
 He has over 200 videos on machine learning, information theory and
stats.  The videos I've sampled so far have been excellent.  Very
lucid.
