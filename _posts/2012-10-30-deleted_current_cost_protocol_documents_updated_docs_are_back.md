**Update 5/1/2016: CurrentCost have kindly allowed me to put these docs
back onto [the GitHub
wiki](https://github.com/JackKelly/rfm_edf_ecomanager/wiki)! The post
below is just kept for posterity's sake...**

I'm really sorry but I'm afraid I've had to remove the Current Cost
protocol details from the [GitHub
wiki](https://github.com/JackKelly/rfm_edf_ecomanager/wiki) for my
rfm\_edf\_ecomanager project.

[Current Cost](http://www.currentcost.com/) got in touch a little while
ago. (My blog had showed up on one of their [Google
Alerts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Alerts)). They were very
friendly and were genuinely interested in the work I had been doing. But
they did request that I delete two wiki pages which describe the
workings of the Current Cost protocols (reverse engineered by a group of
us). So I have deleted those two pages.

The open-source advocate in me did consider defiantly keeping the
documentation online. But I think the pragmatic, diplomatic and polite
option is to comply with Current Cost's wishes. To start with, they have
been very friendly (they haven't served me with a formal take-down
notice or anything like that). And the smart metering world appears to
be quite small so it would be a big mistake to annoy one of the major
players! To be honest, I'm somewhat relieved that we're allowed to keep
the code online.
