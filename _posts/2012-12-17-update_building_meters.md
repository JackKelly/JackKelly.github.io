Just a very quick update. Recent work has been focussed on getting the
energy meters ready for the MSc group who will be doing a project on
"VIsualisation and Analysis of Domestic Electrical Energy Consumption"
next term. Specifically, I've been working to get the [Open Energy
Monitor EmonTX](http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/emontx) talking to my
[rfm\_edf\_ecomanager Nanode
code](https://github.com/JackKelly/rfm_edf_ecomanager/) and [discussing
ways to eak as much
accuracy](http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/node/1629) from the
measurement hardware as possible. And trying to find a way to measure
reactive power for students who won't be able to measure mains voltage
and phase angle directly (this is discussed in depth
[here](http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/node/1568)). <!--break-->
