I've just put all my existing smart meter data [on
github](https://github.com/JackKelly/domesticPowerData).

<div>

This dataset isn't especially useful for NILM work yet because I don't
have a "ground truth" record of each appliance's state change.  This
will change when I install my [24 individual appliance
monitors](/monitoring_individual_appliances).

Oli Parson has created [a list of other smart meter datasets on his
blog](http://op106phd.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/public-data-sets-for-nialm.html?showComment=1340363292018#c89872309841415783).
