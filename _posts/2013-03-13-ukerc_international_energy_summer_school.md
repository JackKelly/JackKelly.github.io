I've just stumbled across an interesting opportunity: a [week-long
summer school at
Warwick](http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/support/tiki-index.php?page=UKERC+Summer+School+New#)
from 7-12th July 2013 specifically for 2nd year PhD students doing PhDs
related to Energy. It's free to attend but apparently the summer school
is significantly oversubscribed. It sounds like it might be a good
opportunity to present my work to a wide community of researchers and
also to network with a diverse bunch of interesting people.

I wonder if any of the (small number of!) folks who read my blog have
been in previous years (or might be tempted to apply this year)?! I'm
going to apply now...

**Update 27/3/2013: I've been accepted to attend. Yay!** <!--break-->
