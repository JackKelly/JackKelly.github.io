 Last weekend my wife and I went to Belfast for one of our best friend's
30th birthday parties.  We travelled from London to Belfast by EasyJet
and from Belfast to London by train and ferry.  We did look into getting
the train & ferry for the outbound journey but unfortunately it takes
too long: the journey takes about 13 hours door to door.  But we
finished work at 11pm on the Friday and we had to be in Belfast for 2pm
on Saturday.  Flying was the only way to get to Belfast in time.  To be
honest, we had planned to return by plane too but the ash cloud looked
set to disrupt our flight so we got a refund and booked a train and
ferry home!

The view from our plane over Northern Ireland

The single plane journey from London to Belfast cost £60 per passenger.
 The train & ferry cost [£42 per passenger for the entire
journey](http://www.seat61.com/NorthernIreland.htm) (it's a single price
no matter if you book on the day or in advance).  The plane was in the
air for about 1 hour.  The train & ferry took a bit over 12 hours from
station to station.

Looking out over the Irish countryside

So, how do you get from Belfast to London without flying?  There are
several ways.  The way we did it was:

-   train from Belfast to Dublin
-   15 minute bus ride to Dublin Ferry Port
-   ferry to Holyhead
-   train to Chester
-   train to London

 And how do they compare in terms of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions? (updated with
[ferry
CO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferry#Sustainability)~[2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferry#Sustainability)~[emission
figures from
WikiPedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferry#Sustainability))

![CO2 emissions of return trip London to Belfast](files/London_to_Belfast_CO2_emissions_table.png)

All the trains were diesel electric averaging about 75% occupancy, the
plane was about 90% full. Sources: [plane &
train](http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0Agol553XfuDZdHlWSmRRckpXZWdSczdoVVBjbHU2dHc&hl=en_GB),
[ferry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferry#Sustainability)

The flight from London to Belfast emitted about 163kg CO<sub>2</sub> per
passenger.   The train + ferry option from Belfast to London (750km
total) emitted 73kg CO<sub>2</sub> per passenger (less than half the emissions of
the flight from London to Belfast), with the vast majority coming from
the fast diesel ferry (travelling at about 60km/h).  If the transport
infrastructure changed, how would the CO<sub>2</sub> change?  Some permutations:

-   If we had gotten diesel-electric trains across land (as is currently
    the default) but sailed across the Irish sea, propelled by wind
    instead of taking the ferry then the entire journey from Belfast to
    London would have emitted just 25kg CO<sub>2</sub> per passenger
-   If there was a tunnel running electric trains beneath the Irish Sea,
    the total Belfast to London emissions would have been 28 kg CO<sub>2</sub>
    per passenger ([electric trains \~ 0.035kWh/p/km at 100%
    occupancy](http://explorer.amee.com/categories/Specific_electric_trains).
    UK grid = 0.544kgCO<sub>2</sub>/kWh.  So electric trains = 19 gCO<sub>2</sub>/p/km)
-   If all the trains were electric but we still got a diesel ferry:
    60kg CO<sub>2</sub> per passenger for the entire journey
-   If the entire journey could be accomplished on electric trains: 14kg
    CO<sub>2</sub> per passenger for Belfast to London.

All in all, this is just another reason to stop talking about it and
actually learn to sail!

How did the journeys compare in terms of comfort and easy?  Well, the
outbound flight was easy to book (not least because my wife did it!) and
was pretty painless.  Hanging around in Belfast International airport
for 6 hours only to be eventually be told the flight had been cancelled
was less fun.  (Many thanks to my parents for researching the ash cloud
late on a Monday night and calling us with the details!)  Booking the
train & ferry initially looked like it would've been very easy because
it's possible to buy a single ticket which covers the entire journey
(which is excellent news).  But, unfortunately, there aren't any
FastTicket printing machines in Belfast so we couldn't book our tickets
the evening before travelling for collection in the morning, instead we
had to buy our tickets at one Belfast station and then travel to another
Belfast station to get the train.  But the office opened at 9am and the
default train from Belfast was due to leave at 8am so I had to spend
midnight to 1am figuring out an alternative route which left Belfast at
10:30am so we had time to buy our tickets.  The various websites I used
to research travel information often had poor usability and some were
just plain broken.  Once we had booked our tickets, the train and ferry
was actually a lovely way to travel; the countryside is gorgeous and our
fellow passengers were very friendly.  The food on the ferry was fine
and the gold, green & red colour scheme was, um, memorable.  The fact
that Belfast Central station was playing Jeremy Kyle on the public
plasmas screens was mildly surreal.

In a few week's time, we're going to Spain via train.  I'll blog about
that soon.  I expect the trip from London to Spain via train to be far
greener than London to Spain via plane because the entire journey is
done on trains and doesn't involve any ferries (yay for the channel
tunnel!)

Here are some photos from the trip:

A quick health warning about emissions calculations: it is logically
impossible to obtain a near-perfect statistic when calculating the
carbon emissions attributable to an action without defining a very tight
scope (do you include the energy embedded in the trains themselves? What
about the tracks? Do you include the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions produced by
drilling and pumping the gas which powers many UK power stations, or
just the emissions coming out the flu? Didn't the train occupancy vary?
What about NOx emissions, water usage etc etc)  The figures I've used
are pretty rough and ready.  But the aim here isn't to calculate the
carbon footprint to multiple decimal places, the aim is to help answer
the question "which is less damaging to the environment: train or
plane"?  To that end, we only need rough figures so we can get a feel
for which option has the largest CO<sub>2</sub> emissions associated with it.

**Update**: It's also worth noting that the total climate forcings
attributable to aviation are believed to be 2-4 times greater than the
aircraft's CO<sub>2</sub> emissions alone, largely because a bi-product of
burning fossil fuels, nitric oxide, is converted more efficiently into
tropospheric ozone (a potent greenhouse gas) when injected into the
upper atmosphere by cruising aircraft than NO~x~ emissions at the
surface (there's[a good summary on
WikiPedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_and_the_environment)).
 However, there is a fair amount of uncertainty in the "2-4 times"
figure and it's also possible that the London to Belfast flight didn't
get to a high enough altitude for the NO~x~ -&gt; Ozone effect to be
significant.  But it's likely that the total radiative forcings
attributable to flying from London to Belfast are *at least* 2-3 times
larger (and possibly 6 times larger) than the land & sea alternative
route.  Hat-tip to Fergus in the comments below.

Update2: Finding authoritative numbers for the grammes of CO2 emitted
per passenger per km for each mode of transport is pretty tricky.  I've
used one set of numbers in my calculations.  Here are some other
numbers(!):

-   From the Booking Confirmation print-out that came with our tickets
    (produced by National Rail, I think):  All these numbers are grammes
    of CO2 per passenger per km:
    -   Trains = 57
    -   Aeroplane = 187
    -   Bus/Coach = 69
    -   Diesel car = 99
    -   Petrol car = 103
    -   Motorcycle = 117
-   Ferry emissions range MASSIVELY.  Some estimates are below
    100gCO2/p/km, some estimates are as high as 800gCO2/p/km.

    -   Ferry = 115.2
    -   Train = 57.7
