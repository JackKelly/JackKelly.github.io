The London School of Economics produce an excellent series of podcasts. 
Last night I listened to "[State of the World Economy in
2012](http://www2.lse.ac.uk/newsAndMedia/videoAndAudio/channels/publicLecturesAndEvents/player.aspx?id=1316)". 
Packed with lots of juicy economics facts and analysis.  One point which
stuck in my mind was the suggestion that, in previous global economic
slumps, a natural ballancing force has been the reduction of commodity
prices.  Yet, this time around, commodity prices are not reducing; far
from it: most commodity prices are at or near their peak values despite
very low growth in many developed countries.<!--break-->
