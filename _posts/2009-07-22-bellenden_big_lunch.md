On Sunday 19th July 2009, communities all round the UK took to the
streets to share home-made food and meet the neighbours. This is a quick
little video of the Bellenden Big Lunch in Peckham, South East London.
It was an absolutely fantastic afternoon. I can't wait until the Big
Lunch 2010! If I had it my way, we'd do this every Sunday! Many, many
thanks to the organisers, the musicians and the folks who provided food.

Geeky details: Shot on a Panasonic GH1 at 720p50 with the stock lens and
a Nikon 17-55mm f2.8 DX. Graded in Premiere Pro CS4.1. All handheld
(poorly!) Excuse the shakiness! My Fader ND filter hasn't arrived yet so
the shutterspeed was uncomfortably swift.

I'm experimenting a bit with different online video hosting services.
I've uploaded the video to ExposureRoom, Vimeo and YouTube. I've been
pleasantly surprised by YouTube. The video quality has improved
significantly recently.
