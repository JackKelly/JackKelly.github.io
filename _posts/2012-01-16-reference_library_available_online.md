I've been using [Zotero](http://www.zotero.org/) as my reference manager
for my MSc project and my PhD.  It's free.  It's open source.  It's
awesome. One of the really nice things about Zotero is that you can
easily publish your library.  So [that's what I've
done](https://www.zotero.org/jack_kelly/items). There are references on
climate science, smart meter non-intrusive load monitoring
([NILM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonintrusive_load_monitoring)),
graphical models and a few other subjects.
