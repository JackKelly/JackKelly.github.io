Absolutely true.  But there are few physical processes capable of
heating up the Earth's oceans, atmosphere and land on timescales of
multiple decades.  Science, as you know, isn't about certainty.  The
point is that we can can analyse all the natural phenomena we know about
and we can come to the conclusion that anthropogenic GHG emissions are
by far and away the most powerful explanation for the warming we've
seen, especially over the past 30 years.  If you want to cross your
fingers and hope that the last 30 years' warming is entirely down to
something completely outside the scope of modern science and that
hopefully it'll stop soon then please don't be surprised if folks like
me don't join your club.

Er.  I'm not sure what a "proof" would look like in the wild away from
pure mathematics.  If you mean "there is no *evidence* that this past
century's warming is man made" then that statement can be easily
falsified.  Try this for starters:

I'm not sufficiently good at statistics to tell whether or not Mann's
claims are robust or not.  As far as I'm concerned, feel free to delete
Mann and the hockey stick from the literature if it makes you feel
better.  It doesn't change the hypothesis that we will soon be (if we
aren't already) in an environment which will be distinctly less
habitable than the pre-industrial environment, and that we can do
something about that if we wish.

There are 2 problems with that statement.

Problem 1: it's simply not true that average global surface temps have
fallen this decade.  The trend from 2000 until now is a rise in surface
temp (this is shown in both HADCRUh3 and GISSTEMP).

People often ask "how come some people say the planet has cooled and
others say the planet has warmed"?  The short answer is that the signal
is noisy and you can find any trend you want to find if you cherry pick
the start and stop dates and keep the timeslice below about 10 years.
 You need to look at trends of, ideally, at least 20-25 years to see the
AGW signal behind the noise.  This post is an excellent illustration of
the problem:

http://woodfortrees.org/notes.php\#trends

Problem 2: even if surface temps had fallen over the course of 10 years,
this wouldn't falsify AGW because 10 years is too short a timeslice to
produce statistically powerful trends.  Look at the numbers: AGW
predicts that average surface temps will increase about 0.2 degrees C
per decade or 0.02 degrees C per year.  But natural variation
(especially El Nino / La Nina) can cause global temp differences of up
to 0.5 degrees C per year.  Hence you really need to look at trends of
20-25 years (this number is not arbitrary; this is basic statistical
analysis: 0.5 / 0.02 = 25).  It's worth noting that 1998 was especially
hot because of a very strong El Nino (warming) event while a strong La
Nina event cooled the planet from 2006-7.

This paper discusses this further:

> I’m curious. How was that emitted IR measured a century ago?

Of course emitted IR wasn't measured by man-made satellites a century
ago.  But the measured trend for the duration of the measurements
(starting in 1970) is consistent with AGW.  Here's a paper discussing
this:

Eh?  I was under the impression that I had actually considered many (if
not all) of the alternative mechanisms.  You're simply ignoring the
facts when you state that I'm ignoring "all possible alternative
mechanisms".
