I have now left Imperial, so I am moving the April 2017 release of my disaggregated electricity dataset, [UK-DALE](/data/), from my Imperial FTP server to the UK Energy Research Council's [Energy Data Centre](http://ukerc.rl.ac.uk/DC/).  It will take some time to transfer (it's 10 TBytes!) but you can already see [some of the data on the EDC](http://data.ukedc.rl.ac.uk/simplebrowse/edc/efficiency/residential/EnergyConsumption/Domestic/UK-DALE-2017).

Also, because I am unlikely to be working on energy disaggregation in the foreseeable future, and because it isn't really practical to store and publish more than 10 TBytes of data without a university's faster Internet connection, I have stopped recording UK-DALE in my house (House 1).  It's also a little tedious to collect data from a house; and we're about to do some building work so the plugs and data logger would have been disturbed anyway.  So the April 2017 update will be the last update of UK-DALE!  I felt a little sad taking it all apart; I really enjoyed engineering the data collection system.  On the up-side, removing the data collection system will probably (somewhat ironically) reduce our home's energy consumption (because the plugs and data logger constantly draw power)!
