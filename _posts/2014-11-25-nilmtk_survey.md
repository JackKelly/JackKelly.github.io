We've seen some really encouraging adoption of
[NILMTK](http://nilmtk.github.io) (our open-source toolkit for
non-intrusive load monitoring) since we started work on it a year ago.
However, it's quite hard to keep track of how people our using the
toolkit, what features they'd like to see, and what direction the
toolkit should be heading in. For this reason, we've created a [NILMTK
Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1JlGn0pRgAIj152PJtVsGEUe9OVv2naWbdDHosJ3sHko/viewform?c=0&w=1),
which will hopefully solve these problems. Please fill out the survey if
you have any interest in energy disaggregation research, and let us know
what's important to you. Thanks!
