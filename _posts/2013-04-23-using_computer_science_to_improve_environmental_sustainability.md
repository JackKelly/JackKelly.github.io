I believe that computer science geeks have an important role to play in
engineering our way out of the various environmental problems we
currently find ourselves lumbered with.

This blog post is a non-exhaustive list of interesting subject areas for
folks who, like me, are interested in both computer science and
environmental sustainability. It aims to provide an (incomplete) answer
to the question: how can a computer scientist contribute measurable
improvements to our environmental sustainability?

*update 5th April 2016* I have [moved this blog post to
github](https://github.com/JackKelly/climate-change-mitigation) so other
folks can add to this list!
