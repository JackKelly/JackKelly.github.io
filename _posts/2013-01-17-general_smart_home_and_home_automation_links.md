Just a list of links with some notes. By no means exhaustive. Please,
please go ahead an leave a comment if you know of any other good home
automation links!

-   [Robert Hekkers](http://blog.hekkers.net/) (an amazing hacker
    in Holland) has done lots and LOTS of "smart home hacking". [Here's
    the web interface to his Domotica home automation / monitoring
    system](http://www.hekkers.net/domotica/). He monitors gas usage,
    power usage, water, heating, light, temperature, motion, taking
    photos when someone presses the door bell, which windows are open
    etc etc. Remarkable stuff.
-   [Home Automation Hub (HAH)](http://www.homeautomationhub.com/): an
    open-source system running on a re-purposed router. Active forum
    and wiki.
-   [Google's "Andriod@Home"
    project](http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/24/what-happened-to-android-at-home/).
-   [WikiPedia page on Home
    Automation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_automation)
-   [Fhem](http://fhem.de/fhem.html) "is a GPL'd perl server for
    house automation. It is used to automate some common tasks in the
    household like switching lamps / shutters / heating / etc. and to
    log events like temperature / humidity / power consumption. The
    program runs as a server, you can control it via web or smartphone
    frontends, telnet or TCP/IP directly."
-   [automatedhome.co.uk](http://www.automatedhome.co.uk/)
-   [SmartThings](http://smartthings.com/) on Kickstarter "SmartThings
    makes it easy to connect the things in your physical world to
    the Internet. You can monitor, control, automate, and have fun with
    them from anywhere - at home or abroad, city or country. We've made
    it possible to install apps that mash up and interact with your
    SmartThings, as well as online and other services, unlocking a world
    of possibilities and unlimited potential to make your life easier,
    more convenient and fun. We call these SmartApps."
-   [nest](http://www.nest.com/) - smart and pretty heating control (but
    no room-by-room control?! gah.)
-   [Open Remote](http://www.openremote.org/display/HOME/OpenRemote) -
    "Open Source Automation Platform"
-   Open standards are essential (surely?)
-   [OPENARCH](http://www.openarch.cc/) "*Openarch is a real prototype
    of a smart home. The first home designed from scratch to incorporate
    a digital layer connecting the house and its elements to
    the Internet. Its inhabitants lead a new digital and connected life.
    It is flexible and thanks to its ability to transform, it can adapt
    to any condition that the user requires.*" (thanks
    [Becky](http://rebeccaajones.wordpress.com/) for the link!)
