Not all wide-angle adapters produce barrel distortion. Aspheric adapters
are particularly distortion free. The "Bolex Aspheron" (or some-such
name) is apparently "the best wide-angle adapter" available. But you
have to make your own housing for it and it costs about Â£420.Tom
Hardwick over on dvinfo.net knows lots about aspheric lenses.
[Wittner-Kinotechnik](http://www.wittner-kinotechnik.de/katalog/08_aufna/b_optike.php)
in Germany sell aspheric adapters

There are loads of threads on dvinfo.net about wideangle adapters

For my Sony HC7, I've opted for the [Raynox HD-5050
Pro](http://www.raynox.co.jp/english/video/hd5050pro/index.htm) 0.5x
37mm lens
