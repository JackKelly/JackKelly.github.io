At the NILM Workshop last Wednesday, I presented a poster on "[Neural
NILM: Deep Neural Networks Applied to Energy
Disaggregation](https://jack-kelly.com/files/writing/NeuralNILM_poster.pdf)".
It was a lot of fun discussing it with the participants! There's still a
lot of work to do but this approach does work reasonably well right now.
More details will come later...

Update:  Please see the full [Neural NILM paper here](https://jack-kelly.com/files/writing/neural_nilm.pdf).
