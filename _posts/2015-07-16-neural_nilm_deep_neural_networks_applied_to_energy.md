At the NILM Workshop last Wednesday, I presented a poster on "[Neural
NILM: Deep Neural Networks Applied to Energy
Disaggregation](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~dk3810/writing/NeuralNILM_poster.png)".
It was a lot of fun discussing it with the participants! There's still a
lot of work to do but this approach does work reasonably well right now.
More details will come later...
