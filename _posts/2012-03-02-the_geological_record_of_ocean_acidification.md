A rather worrisome paper has just been published in Science magazine.
The authors conclude:

> \[T\]he current rate of (mainly fossil fuel) CO<sub>2</sub> release stands out
> as capable of driving a combination and magnitude of ocean geochemical
> changes potentially unparalleled in at least the last \~300 \[million
> years\] of Earth history, raising the possibility that we are entering
> an unknown territory of marine ecosystem change.

An excellent summary is available on [Ars
Technica](http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2012/03/ocean-acidification-could-become-worst-in-at-least-300-million-years.ars) (which
is where I first read about this paper).  The paper is B. Hönisch et al,
‘The Geological Record of Ocean Acidification’, Science, vol. 335, no.
6072, pp. 1058–1063, Mar. 2012. [DOI:
10.1126/science.1208277](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1208277).

On the plus side, reading about this research has given me more
enthusiasm to finish [insulating our
bedrooms](/planning_to_insulate_bedrooms_this_weekend) this weekend!
