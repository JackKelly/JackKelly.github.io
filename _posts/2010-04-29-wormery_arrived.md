A friend bought us a wormery as our wedding present and it's just
arrived.  Owning a wormery wont reduce the amount of food waste we send
to landfill because we already send most of our food waste to our
compost heap or dog.  But owning a wormery will hopefully mean that we
can reduce (perhaps to zero) the amount of plant food and potting
compost we buy (which isn't much).  Plus, who doesn't love worms?

Eventually I'll build a shelf above the compost bin to store the
wormery.
