This blog entry is part of [a series of posts introducing the topic of
smart meter disaggregation](/taxonomy/term/104).  This specific post
looks at the wider reasons for reducing energy consumption.  In other
words, this post explains some of the reasons which keep me up at night
when I'm not distracted by work! The reasons for reducing energy
consumption typically fall into one of two categories: financial and
environmental.  We'll focus mostly on the consumption of *electricity*
but the arguments are mostly applicable to the consumption of all sorts
of energy.

### Financial reasons

There's been a lot of coverage in the press recently about high energy
prices.  In January 2012, for example, the [Citizens' Advice Bureau
stated that 43% of people are worried that they can't afford their next
fuel
bill](http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2012/jan/16/citizens-advice-worried-fuel-bill). 
The following plot shows average annual domestic electricity prices in
the UK from 1994 to 2011 (data from [DECC,
2011](http://www.decc.gov.uk/assets/decc/statistics/source/prices/qep222.xls)).

Electricity prices have risen from 2004 to today; but, when compared to
data from the 1990s, today's prices are not quite as earth-shatteringly
high as some news papers would have us believe.

What has caused the 35% price rise (in real terms) from 2003 to 2011? 
I'm no expert but let's discuss two datasets which shed some light on
what's going on.

<!--break-->

#### Global energy consumption trends

We're probably all aware that global demand for energy in increasing
but, until I looked at the data, I was unaware *just how quickly* world
primary energy demand is increasing:

![World primary energy demand, taken from BP Statistical Energy Review
2011](/files/blog/worldPrimaryEnergy.png "World primary energy demand, taken from BP Statistical Energy Review 2011")

<small>(Plot of World Primary Energy Demand taken from [BP Statistical
Review of World Energy
2011](http://www.bp.com/assets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/reports_and_publications/statistical_energy_review_2011/STAGING/local_assets/pdf/statistical_review_of_world_energy_full_report_2011.pdf))</small>

A striking feature of the graph above is that energy demand from
non-[OECD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_for_Economic_Co-operation_and_Development)
countries has increased by more than 50% *over the past ten years*; and
the good folks at BP think this trend will continue for the foreseeable
future.

In 2000, China used half as much energy as the USA. In 2009, China
overtook the USA to become the world's largest energy user ([IEA,
2010](http://www.iea.org/weo/docs/weo2010/WEO2010_ES_English.pdf)). The
International Energy Agency projects that Chinese consumption will
increase by 75% between 2008 and 2035, and that Indian energy
consumption will more than double over that same period (although India
will still consume less energy in 2035 than either the USA or
China) ([IEA,
2010](http://www.iea.org/weo/docs/weo2010/WEO2010_ES_English.pdf)).

Even if the geology can keep up (which is questionable), it will require
enormous amounts of investment to quench the every-increasing thirst of
countries like China and India.  It is almost inevitable that demand
from non-OECD countries will exert considerable upward price pressure on
energy.

As a side note: in a recent [LSE podcast on "State of the World Economy
in 2012"](/lse_podcast_state_of_the_world_economy_in_2012), Jean-Michel
Severino (inspector general at the French Ministry of Finance) noted
that one of the distinguishing features of the current global economic
slow-down is that commodity prices have remained high.  In previous
world economic slow-downs, Severino noted that commodity prices have
acted as a kind of "buoyancy aid": the economy slows, which in turn
decreases demand, which reduces commodity prices, which makes it easier
for the global economy to consume commodities and hence grow again.
 This time around, commodity prices have at best plateaued and many have
actually *increased* despite most of the western world experiencing low
or even negative growth.

#### UK energy trends

The UK is especially exposed to energy price rises. The UK makes
extensive use of natural gas for heat and power generation. Between 1995
and 2004 the UK was not just self-sufficient for gas but it was a *net
exporter* of natural gas pumped from the North Sea ([BP,
2011](http://www.bp.com/assets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/reports_and_publications/statistical_energy_review_2011/STAGING/local_assets/pdf/statistical_review_of_world_energy_full_report_2011.pdf "BP Statistical Review of World Energy, 2011")).  Gas
production from the North Sea peaked and began its terminal decline in
2000 hence the UK has been a net *importer* since 2004 ([BP,
2011](http://www.bp.com/assets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/reports_and_publications/statistical_energy_review_2011/STAGING/local_assets/pdf/statistical_review_of_world_energy_full_report_2011.pdf "BP Statistical Review of World Energy, 2011")),
requiring us to buy increasing amounts of gas on the volatile global
market. Gas production from the North Sea halved between 2000 and 2010
(data from [BP,
2011](http://www.bp.com/assets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/reports_and_publications/statistical_energy_review_2011/STAGING/local_assets/pdf/statistical_review_of_world_energy_full_report_2011.pdf "BP Statistical Review of World Energy, 2011")):

 

<object data="/files/blog/UKgas.svg" height="400" type="image/svg+xml" width="700">![UK
gas production, data from BP Statistical Review of World Energy
2011](/files/blog/UKgas.png "UK gas production, data from BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2011"){width="700"
height="400"}</object>

Recent research suggests the UK may have substantial “unconventional”
gas reserves in the form of on-shore shale gas. The British Geological
Survey believes the UK may be sitting on 150 billion cubic meters (150 ×
10^9^ m^3^) of shale gas ([BGS & DECC,
2011](http://og.decc.gov.uk/assets/og/bo/onshore-paper/uk-onshore-shalegas.pdf "The Unconventional Hydrocarbon Resources of Britain's Onshore Basins - Shale Gas, 2011")). However,
to put this into perspective, the UK consumes 100 billion cubic meters
of gas per year, so our shale gas reserves will not fundamentally change
our energy mix (unlike in the USA where shale gas has been a “veritable
game changer”: shale gas currently accounts for 23% of US gas supply and
is projected to grow to 40% by 2030 ([FACTS,
2011](http://www.nbr.org/downloads/pdfs/eta/PES_2011_Facts_Global_Energy.pdf ""Unconventional Gas and Implications for the LNG Market - FACTS Global Energy" (2011)."))).

### Environmental reasons for reducing energy consumption

The production of electricity also has environmental costs. In 2010, 75%
of the UK's electricity was produced from hydrocarbon-fired power
stations ([DECC,
2011](http://www.decc.gov.uk/assets/decc/11/stats/publications/dukes/2307-dukes-2011-chapter-5-electricity.pdf ""Digest Of UK Energy Statistics (DUKES) Chapter 5: Electricity", UK Department for Energy and Climate Change (2011).")),
producing 191 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>. This represents 39% of the UK's
total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, making electricity generation the largest single
source of CO<sub>2</sub> in the UK ([DECC,
2011](http://www.decc.gov.uk/assets/decc/Statistics/climate_change/1515-statrelease-ghg-emissions-31032011.pdf ""UK Climate Change Sustainable Development Indicator: 2010 Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Provisional Figures and 2009 Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Final Figures by Fuel Type and End-user.", UK Department of Energy and Climate Change (2011).")).
The domestic sector is the single largest load on the electricity grid,
accounting for 31% of the UK's electricity demand ([DECC,
2011](http://www.decc.gov.uk/assets/decc/11/stats/publications/dukes/2307-dukes-2011-chapter-5-electricity.pdf ""Digest Of UK Energy Statistics (DUKES) Chapter 5: Electricity", UK Department for Energy and Climate Change (2011).")).
Whilst there has been increasing media attention on CO<sub>2</sub>, it is worth
briefly considering some peer-reviewed evidence not least because media
coverage of the issue is often more noise than signal.

Human activity worldwide currently produces 29 billion tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>
per year ([IPCC,
2007](http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/publications_and_data_reports.shtml ""Fourth Assessment Report: Climate Change 2007 (AR4)", IPCC (2007).")).
Since the industrial revolution began in 1880, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>
concentration has increased from 280 parts per million to 391 ppm in
2011
([NOAA](http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/ ""Trends in Carbon Dioxide sampled from Mauna Loa, US National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration Research website".")),
higher than any time during the last 800,000 years ([Luthi et al,
2008](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v453/n7193/full/nature06949.html "Luthi, Dieter and Le Floch, Martine and Bereiter, Bernhard and Blunier, Thomas and Barnola, Jean-Marc and Siegenthaler, Urs and Raynaud, Dominique and Jouzel, Jean and Fischer, Hubertus and Kawamura, Kenji and Stocker, Thomas F., "High-resolution carbon dioxide concentration record 650,000-800,000 years before present", Nature (2008), 379--382.")),
and likely higher than any time in the past 20 million years ([Pearson
et al,
2000](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v406/n6797/full/406695a0.html "Pearson, Paul N. and Palmer, Martin R., "Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations over the past 60 million years", Nature (2000), 695--699."))
(to put this into some context: anatomically modern humans are
hypothesised to have first appeared around 200,000 years ago ([McDougall
et al,
2005](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v433/n7027/full/nature03258.html "McDougall, Ian and Brown, Francis H. and Fleagle, John G., "Stratigraphic placement and age of modern humans from Kibish, Ethiopia", Nature (2005), 733--736."))
 and agriculture began around 10,000 years ago ([Gupta,
2004](http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/jul102004/54.pdf "Gupta, A.K., "Origin of agriculture and domestication of plants and animals linked to early Holocene climate amelioration", Current Science (2004), 54--59."))).
This increased CO<sub>2</sub> concentration has two main detrimental effects on
the environment: it enhances the “greenhouse effect” ([Wood,
1909](http://www.wmconnolley.org.uk/sci/wood_rw.1909.html "Wood, R.W., "Note on the Theory of the Greenhouse", The London, Edinborough and Dublin Philosophical Magazine (1909), 319--320."); [IPCC,
2007](http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/publications_and_data_reports.shtml ""Fourth Assessment Report: Climate Change 2007 (AR4)", IPCC (2007).")) by
reducing the rate at which the planet loses infrared radiation into
space and it acidifies the oceans ([Caldeira et al,
2003](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/425365a "Caldeira, Ken and Wickett, Michael E., "Oceanography: Anthropogenic carbon and ocean pH", Nature (2003), 365.");
[Orr et al,
2005](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v437/n7059/full/nature04095.html "Orr, James C. and Fabry, Victoria J. and Aumont, Olivier and Bopp, Laurent and Doney, Scott C. and Feely, Richard A. and Gnanadesikan, Anand and Gruber, Nicolas and Ishida, Akio and Joos, Fortunat and Key, Robert M. and Lindsay, Keith and Maier-Reimer, Ernst and Matear, Richard and Monfray, Patrick and Mouchet, Anne and Najjar, Raymond G. and Plattner, Gian-Kasper and Rodgers, Keith B. and Sabine, Christopher L. and Sarmiento, Jorge L. and Schlitzer, Reiner and Slater, Richard D. and Totterdell, Ian J. and Weirig, Marie-France and Yamanaka, Yasuhiro and Yool, Andrew, "Anthropogenic ocean acidification over the twenty-first century and its impact on calcifying organisms", Nature (2005), 681--686.")),
damaging marine ecosystems.

There is a considerable body of evidence indicating that the world's
systems are already changing. For example: the amount of infrared
radiation emitted from the top of the atmosphere into space is
decreasing ([Harries,
2001](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v410/n6826/full/410355a0.html "Harries, John E. and Brindley, Helen E. and Sagoo, Pretty J. and Bantges, Richard J., "Increases in greenhouse forcing inferred from the outgoing longwave radiation spectra of the Earth in 1970 and 1997", Nature (2001), 355--357."))
(consistent with the hypothesis that increased atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>
concentration scatters more IR back to earth's surface), global
land-ocean temperatures increased by about 0.8°C over the period 1880 to
2010 ([GISTemp](http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs_v3/)):

[![Taken from NASA
GISTemp](http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs_v3/Fig.A2.gif)](http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs_v3/)

Ocean heat content is increasing ([Schuckmann et al,
2009](http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2009/2008JC005237.shtml "Schuckmann, K. von and Gaillard, F. and Traon, P.-Y. Le, "Global hydrographic variability patterns during 2003–2008", Journal of Geophysical Research (2009), 17 PP..")),
Arctic sea ice is decreasing in extent ([Johannessen & Ola,

and volume:

The Arctic sea ice loss is unexplainable by any of the known natural
variabilities ([Polyak et al,
2010](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379110000429 "Polyak, Leonid and Alley, Richard B. and Andrews, John T. and Brigham-Grette, Julie and Cronin, Thomas M. and Darby, Dennis A. and Dyke, Arthur S. and Fitzpatrick, Joan J. and Funder, Svend and Holland, Marika and Jennings, Anne E. and Miller, Gifford H. and O'Regan, Matt and Savelle, James and Serreze, Mark and St. John, Kristen and White, James W.C. and Wolff, Eric, "History of sea ice in the Arctic", Quaternary Science Reviews (2010), 1757--1778.")). If
this trend continues then we will see an ice-free summer Arctic within
the next 30 years ([Wang & Overland,
2009](http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2009/2009GL037820.shtml "Wang, Muyin and Overland, James E., "A sea ice free summer Arctic within 30 years?", Geophysical Research Letters (2009).")).
Mean total Arctic ice volume was about 15,000 km^3^ from 1979-2010; so a
y-axis value of about “-15” on the graph above corresponds to zero ice
volume.

The Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets are losing mass ([Cazenave,
2006](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/314/5803/1250 "Cazenave, Anny, "How fast are the ice sheets melting?", Science (New York, N.Y.) (2006), 1250--1252.")),
the tropical belt is widening ([Seidel et al,

plant populations are moving to higher altitudes ([Lenoir et al,
2008](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/320/5884/1768.abstract "Lenoir, J. and Gégout, J. C. and Marquet, P. A. and de Ruffray, P. and Brisse, H., "A Significant Upward Shift in Plant Species Optimum Elevation During the 20th Century", Science (2008), 1768 --1771.")),
seasons are starting earlier ([Stine et al,
2009](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v457/n7228/full/nature07675.html "Stine, A. R. and Huybers, P. and Fung, I. Y., "Changes in the phase of the annual cycle of surface temperature", Nature (2009), 435--440.")),
sea level rose 195mm between 1870 and 2004 and the rate of sea level
rise is accelerating ([Church & Neil,

Projections for future climate come with considerable uncertainty but
ensemble modelling suggests that, if we continue on current emissions
trajectories, the world is likely to warm by at least 2°C by 2100 and
possibly by as much as 6°C ([Rockstrom et al,
2009](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v461/n7263/full/461472a.html "Rockstrom, Johan and Steffen, Will and Noone, Kevin and Persson, Asa and Chapin, F.

[IPCC,
2007](http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/publications_and_data_reports.shtml ""Fourth Assessment Report: Climate Change 2007 (AR4)", IPCC (2007).")).
(To put this into perspective, the difference in mean surface
temperatures between an ice-age and an interglacial is about 6-8°C).
This warming is likely to have many adverse effects, not least of which
are the desertification of many currently arable areas ([IARU,
2009](http://www.pik-potsdam.de/news/press-releases/files/synthesis-report-web.pdf ""Synthesis Report: Climate Change, global risks, challenges & decisions.", International Alliance of Research Universities: Australian National University, ETH Zürich, National University of Singapore, Peking University, University of California - Berkeley, University of Cambridge, University of Copenhagen, University of Oxford, The University of Tokyo, Yale University (2009)."))
and a probable sea level rise of 0.75 to 1.9 meters by 2100 ([Grinsted
et al,
2009](http://www.springerlink.com/content/527178062596k202/ "Grinsted, Aslak and Moore, J. C. and Jevrejeva, S., "Reconstructing sea level from paleo and projected temperatures 200 to 2100 ad", Climate Dynamics (2009), 461--472.");

Palaeoclimatology studies and modelling suggest that many of these
effects are likely to worsen over subsequent centuries and will be
irreversible for at least the next 3,000 years ([Solomon,

It has been proposed that this stable climate aided human societal
development ([Dansgaard et al,
1993](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/364218a0 "Dansgaard, W. and Johnsen, S. J. and Clausen, H. B. and Dahl-Jensen, D. and Gundestrup, N. S. and Hammer, C. U. and Hvidberg, C. S. and Steffensen, J.

Unfortunately, paleoclimate data also demonstrates the stability
experienced over the past 10,000 years is the exception rather than the

Is there a “safe” amount of warming? At the 2009 United Nations Climate
Change Conference in Copenhagen, 138 countries signed an agreement (the
"[Copenhagen Accord
2009](http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2009/cop15/eng/11a01.pdf#page=4)")
stating that actions should be taken to keep the temperature increase
below 2°C. The 2°C target is a compromise. Even with just 1.5°C of
warming, it is extremely likely that low-lying islands will be
submerged. But temperature increases above about 2.5°C could initiate
the total melting of Greenland's ice sheet ([IARU,
2009](http://www.pik-potsdam.de/news/press-releases/files/synthesis-report-web.pdf ""Synthesis Report: Climate Change, global risks, challenges & decisions.", International Alliance of Research Universities: Australian National University, ETH Zürich, National University of Singapore, Peking University, University of California - Berkeley, University of Cambridge, University of Copenhagen, University of Oxford, The University of Tokyo, Yale University (2009).")) which
contains enough water to raise sea levels by 7 meters ([ACIA,
2005](http://amap.no/acia/ACIAContent.html "Assessment, Arctic Climate Impact and Programme, Arctic Monitoring and Assessment and Fauna, Program for the Conservation of Arctic Flora and and Committee, International Arctic Science, "Arctic climate impact assessment", Cambridge University Press (2005).")).
By how much do we need to reduce emissions in order to provide a
reasonable chance of keeping warming below 2°C? The following figure
(taken from [IARU,
2009](http://www.pik-potsdam.de/news/press-releases/files/synthesis-report-web.pdf ""Synthesis Report: Climate Change, global risks, challenges & decisions.", International Alliance of Research Universities: Australian National University, ETH Zürich, National University of Singapore, Peking University, University of California - Berkeley, University of Cambridge, University of Copenhagen, University of Oxford, The University of Tokyo, Yale University (2009)."))
illustrates that, if we want a 75% chance of limiting warming to 2°C
then global emissions need to peak by 2020, decline rapidly and then go
negative in 2070! (The exact shape of the lines in the graph below are a
little arbitrary; the climate cares about the *area* under each line,
which is proportional to the total mass of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere
(CO<sub>2</sub> has an average lifetime in the atmosphere of around 100
years)). It's an extremely tough challenge.  Note that the analysis
represented in the following graph shows that we have to start to reduce
emissions within the next few years; the longer we wait, the steeper
(and hence more expensive) the reductions need to be.  Even if we start
to reduce emissions in 2020, we still need a 10% year-on-year decline in
emissions, which is historically unprecedented (global emissions are
currently increasing by about 3 or 4% per year).  If there's a single
graph which keeps me up at night, it's this one:

Yes, very steep decreases in CO2 emissions are required, but it's
important to note that reductions are not completely unprecedented.  The
UK, for example,  reduced its emissions by around 20% between 1990 and
2011 (see [the graph of emissions in this Guardian
article](http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/feb/07/uk-emissions-rose-economy-recovered)).
This reduction is probably largely due to the [UK's "dash to
gas"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash_for_Gas) (when we displaced some
coal-fired power generation with natural gas generation, which produces
slightly less CO<sub>2</sub> per unit of electrical
power[1](#footnote1_f95zwl2 "although methane leaks during production may offset climate benefits of natural gas (Tollefson, 2012)"){#footnoteref1_f95zwl2
.see-footnote}) and us effectively off-shoring heavy industry to other
countries.
