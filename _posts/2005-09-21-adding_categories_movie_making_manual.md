I've just managed to waste away an entire morning by adding
[categories](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categorization) to
the [Movie Making
Manual](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Movie_Making_Manual)
[wikibook](http://en.wikibooks.org). But now, hopefully, it'll be easier
to navigate... we're slowly getting to the position where the MMM will
be good enough to start to shout about it.
