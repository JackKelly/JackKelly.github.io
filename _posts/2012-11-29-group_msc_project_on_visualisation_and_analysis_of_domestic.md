I'm hoping to organise a Computer Science MSc group project on
"Visualisation and Analysis of Domestic Electrical Energy Consumption".
One aim of the project is to produce an open-source app tol help people
save energy by producing useful and interesting visualisations (pretty
graphs) of their energy usage. The ultimate aim is to produce something
a bit like Google Powermeter. But better ;)! The full spec of the group
project is available
[here](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~dk3810/VADEEC_proposal.html).

I'd be really eager to hear any comments / suggestions at this (very)
early stage to try to make the project both lots of fun for the students
and also useful to the community. Some specific questions might be:

-   Do you currently use a tool to visualise your energy use? (Such as
    [Current Cost's website](http://my.currentcost.com/demo/) or
    [Cosm](https://cosm.com/) or [open.sen.se](http://open.sen.se/) or
    something similar?)
-   Are there any specific statistics / visualisations that you'd be
    particularly interested in?
-   Would you be interested in being able to share details of your
    energy use with select friends to compare progress?

(To give a bit of context: Group projects run for the duration of the
spring term (11 weeks starting Jan 2013). I'm a PhD student in the
computing department so I'll be supervising the project but the detailed
design is up to the MSc students. Groups usually consist of 5-6 MSc
students. There are no guarantees that a group will actually want to do
the project, of course!) <!--break-->
