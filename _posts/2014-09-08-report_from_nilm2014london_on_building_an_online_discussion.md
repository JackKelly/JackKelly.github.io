The first "[NILM in
London](http://blog.oliverparson.co.uk/2014/09/post-nilm-2014-london.html)"
workshop was held on Wednesday 3rd September. It was a lot of fun and we
had some great conversations. In this blog post, I'd like to try to
summarise the discussion around building an online discussion forum for
NILM. <!--break--> There was strong support for having an online venue
(e.g. an email list) to discuss NILM. Use cases cited included helping
folks to stay up to date with new papers, workshops, software releases;
to discuss technical challenges etc.

How 'open' should the community be?
-----------------------------------

If I remember correctly, everyone at the workshop agreed that mailing
list content should be *readable* by everyone.

Everyone also appeared to agree that a risk with online communities is
that they can become noisy and/or high-traffic and so require some level
of moderation. We didn't discuss this in much detail.

I wrote [a blog
post](http://jack-kelly.com/wiki_and_online_community_for_electricity_disaggregation)
almost a year ago with a proposal to start an online community for NILM.
Why hasn't it happened yet? The honest answer is that I'm afraid it will
guzzle up too much time with noisy questions. But, after seeing the
enthusiasm for an online community, it definitely looks like we should
go ahead and do it.

Which platform?
---------------

I think we agreed that we should first look at Google Groups. If that
isn't sufficient for our needs then we should look elsewhere.

After the event, I had a quick look at the permissions settings on [the
Google Groups support pages](https://support.google.com/groups). It
seems that they have sufficient controls.

Proposal
--------

Please let me know if this plan sounds OK (I've also added some specific
questions...)

-   we set up a Google Group called "NILM" (or "energy disaggregation"?
    or something else? Or should we use a different platform?
    Google+ communities?)
-   new users can subscribe instantly, without requiring moderation (we
    had discussed the idea that new users would have to *request* entry
    to the group and then moderators would accept / reject the request.
    But when would we ever reject a request? There just isn't enough
    information available at this point to judge. We can always change
    the permissions later.)
-   a user's first few posts will be moderated. Once they get into the
    rhythm of the group then they will be able to post immediately
    (without moderation).
-   One big question is whether to have 'sub topics'. e.g. we could have
    sub topics on 'New research papers', 'upcoming events', 'NILM
    algorithms', 'datasets', 'validation', 'jobs' etc. I don't think we
    discussed this at all on Wednesday. My hunch is that we should start
    with a single discussion forum (i.e. no sub topics). Maybe the
    community is sufficiently small to mean that we don't need to
    subdivide the forum? Later, if we need to, we can subdivide
    the forum. Also, if we start with a single forum then this will also
    help to clarify which subforums are required!

Does that sound OK?

Wiki
----

We also briefly discussed building a NILM wiki (building a NILM wiki is
something [I blogged about almost a year
ago](http://jack-kelly.com/wiki_and_online_community_for_electricity_disaggregation).
The general feeling on the NILM workshop on Wednesday was that I should
just get on with building it and present it at the next meetup! At the
NILMTK workshop on Thursday 4th, we discussed how useful it would be to
use the wiki list details and quirks of NILM datasets.
