I did something dumb. And expensive. And potentially dangerous. I blew
up my laptop! How did I achieve this amazing feat? By connecting a
Current Cost Individual Appliance Monitor to my laptop via a Bus Pirate
(note the burnt patch of PCB on the top right of the photo!). I took
care to make sure I was connecting the correct SDI lines, just as I had
successfully done when [sniffing data from my
EnviR](/sniffing_spi_data_from_my_current_cost_envir).

So why did I blow my laptop by connecting to an IAM?

<!--break-->

The IAM's circuit board doesn't connect to the mains earth connection
but I'm pretty sure that my laptop connects ground to mains earth. So I
think the the IAM's ground connection is allowed to float many, many
volts above earth. The end result was a big bang, a dead laptop
(currently awaiting a new motherboard costing several hundred pounds), a
dead Bus Pirate and the event caused the mains ring's
[RCD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual-current_device) to trip;
again suggesting that current was allowed to flow to earth.

Note that the mains earth is not connected to the IAM's circuit board.
DON'T DO WHAT I DID AND TRY TO HACK THE IAM UNLESS YOU REALLY, REALLY
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING! Risk of electricution!

How to avoid this nasty event happening again? I bought an optocoupler
which should allow me to isolate the target device being sniffed and the
Bus Pirate. I bought the Avago HCPL-090J-000E optocoupler ([Â£8.79 from
Farnell](http://uk.farnell.com/jsp/search/productdetail.jsp?SKU=1611323))
which is nice and fast. And [an SMD
adapter](http://uk.farnell.com/jsp/search/productdetail.jsp?SKU=1426172).
Some (most?) optocouplers would struggle to keep up with an SPI clock of
several MHz.

The optocoupler soldered onto its SMD adapter:

Whilst awaiting my new laptop, I've resurrected an old Athlon X2
machine; installed Ubuntu 12.04 on it and, after replacing the heatsink
that had fallen off the CPU, and upgrading the graphics card to one that
can handle Unity's effects, I now have a working development system
again. (Yes, all my work was backed up from my laptop.) It's rather
frustrating because I'm already a bit behind schedule. Never mind. It
could've been worse. I could've electrocuted myself :/

The back of my blown bus pirate:

My lethal hacked IAM. DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME!
