Today, Nipun Batra, Jack Kelly and Oliver Parson are really pleased to
announce the release of [NILMTK: an open source toolkit for
non-intrusive load monitoring](http://nilmtk.github.io). The toolkit
will allow researchers to easily develop algorithms which disaggregate a
household’s total electricity consumption into individual appliances.

Specifically, the toolkit includes:

-   a number of parsers to read public data sets into a common format
-   a suite of statistical functions to analyse such data sets and
    identify potential problems
-   two benchmark energy disaggregation algorithms
-   a suite of evaluation metrics to compare disaggregation algorithms

Further details can be found in the accompanying paper recently accepted
at e-Energy 2014 available via [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.3878)
and [Soton ePrints](http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/364293/):

(the DOI isn't active yet but will be soon)

This release is hopefully just the beginning of the toolkit’s
contribution to energy disaggregation, and as such we welcome feedback
and contributions to all aspects of the project.
