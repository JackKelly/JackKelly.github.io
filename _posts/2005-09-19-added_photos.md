I kicked off my [filmmaking photo
gallery](https://www.flickr.com/photos/37816297@N06/collections/72157627766904375/) last night. I've copied all my filmmaking photos from
my [personal photo gallery](http://www.xlk.org.uk/gallery) and added
photos for the [China Men promo](https://www.flickr.com/photos/37816297@N06/sets/72157627766587031/) and
taken the photos off the DVD for [A Trivial
Pursuit](https://www.flickr.com/photos/37816297@N06/sets/72157627766621775/) (Director Mark scanned these
photos and put them onto the DVD). I still have some more things to do
to my filmmaking photo gallery, including:

-   Go back to the original TIFFs and do some curves tweaking
-   Add photos for the [Teenage Girls Facecream
    promo](http://www.dmiproductions.co.uk/questionable/)
-   Add photos from the Property Apolocalyse Now
-   Scan some more of my Trivial Pursuit photos
