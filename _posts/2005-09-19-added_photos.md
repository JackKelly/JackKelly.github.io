![](/blog/images/china_men.jpg) I kicked off my [filmmaking photo
gallery](/gallery) last night. I've copied all my filmmaking photos from
my [personal photo gallery](http://www.xlk.org.uk/gallery) and added
photos for the [China Men promo](/gallery/v/film_stills/china_men/) and
taken the photos off the DVD for [A Trivial
Pursuit](/gallery/v/film_stills/trivial/) (Director Mark scanned these
photos and put them onto the DVD). I still have some more things to do
to my filmmaking photo gallery, including:

-   Go back to the original TIFFs and do some curves tweaking
-   Add photos for the [Teenage Girls Facecream
    promo](http://www.dmiproductions.co.uk/questionable/)
-   Add photos from the Property Apolocalyse Now
-   Scan some more of my Trivial Pursuit photos
