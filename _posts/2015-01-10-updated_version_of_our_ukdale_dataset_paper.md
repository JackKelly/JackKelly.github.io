[Here's an updated version of our UK-DALE dataset
paper](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4jcwh64ujzp0iwv/scientific-data-2014.pdf?dl=0).
It will be on arXiv on Tuesday. Let me know if you spot any typos!

This new version adds 8 figures and a large table describing the
dataset. And this update adds a fifth house and data from House 1 up to
Jan 5th 2015 ;).

Almost all the new figures in this revision was created using
[NILMTK](http://nilmtk.github.io). The scripts for producing the exact
plots in the paper are available in my [ukdale\_plots
repository](https://github.com/JackKelly/ukdale_plots). On the topic of
NILMTK, I should also mention that UK-DALE is now available as a HDF5
file in NILMTK format. [Here are the download
details](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~dk3810/data).
