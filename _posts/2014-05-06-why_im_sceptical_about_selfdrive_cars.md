A lot of attention has recently been given to self-drive (aka "robot"
cars) recently, including [this very impressive
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csvt6JBAwBk) released last week
of a Google Self-Drive car navigating busy city streets.

Don't get me wrong: There are clearly some *enormously* smart people
working on self-drive cars and the technical issues may well all be
solved very soon (if they haven't already been solved).

But there are two reasons I'm sceptical that we'll see a mass-adoption
of self-drive cars any time soon:

Firstly, there's the whole robot-killing-humans thing. Let's assume that
robot cars are 'perfect' drivers (whatever that means). There will
still, inevitably, come a time when a person does something really dumb
like steps out from behind a parked lorry into the path of the robot
car. Even if the car performs much better than a human driver and stops
as rapidly as physics allows, the human will still suffer serious
injuries. In this situation, I think we can pretty much guarantee that
there will be a media frenzy around the fact that a 'robot' car
killed/maimed a human. The fact that it was the human's fault will be
totally ignored by the media. I would suggest that this single event
will cause the majority of the public to reject robot cars for a long
time.

The second reason is entirely personal: I really can't see myself
wanting a robot car. I actually quite enjoy driving. I also doubt I'd
ever trust my own life (and the lives of my two children, wife and dog)
to a robot driver (especially one that's connected to the Internet).
Heck, our 2007 Ford Focus annoys me because you can really 'feel' the
computer that sits between the accelerator and the fuel injectors.

Anyway... I hope I'm proved wrong and self-driving cars do make it onto
the streets in large numbers. I'm just somewhat sceptical that it will
happen any time soon.
