<p><em>Imperial Computing Science MSc Group Project Proposal, November 2012</em></p>

<h3>The challenge</h3>

<p>As energy costs increase, there is increasing pressure to use energy as efficiently as possible.  The first step towards reducing energy consumption is often to <em>measure</em> your existing consumption.  To this end, millions of people have installed home energy monitors like this one from <a href="http://www.currentcost.com">Current Cost</a>:</p>

<img src="http://treeswaterpeople.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/current-cost-envi-energy-monitor.jpg">

<p>Furthermore, by the end of the decade every home in the UK will have a "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_meter">smart meter</a>" which will digitally measure energy consumption.</p>

<p>The aim of this project is to help solve two challenges:</p>

<p>One challenge is that data from energy meters is not trivial to
  interpret, hence energy data is rarely exploited to its full potential.  For example, if you were given the graph below could you decide what action to take in order to reduce energy consumption?  I know I couldn't!</p>

<img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7033/6812534035_3466d39707_z.jpg"/>

<p>A second challenge is that there is very little open-access power
  meter data available to help the research community build better
  visualisation tools
  and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonintrusive_load_monitoring">disaggregation</a>
  algorithms (disaggregation automatically estimates individual
  appliance energy consumption from a whole-house meter signal).  The
  research community is hungry for more data.</p>

<h3>Two aims of this project</h3>

<h4>1) Data Visualisation and Analysis Tool</h4>

<p>One aim of this project is to produce an attractive, easy-to-use and powerful data visualisation tool to help users understand their own energy consumption data. The raw data might be from whole-house meters, individual appliance monitors or appliance load estimates generated by disaggregation algorithms.

<p>The technologies used to implement these features is your decision but you may like to consider building a <b>web app</b> using modern web technologies like <b>HTML5, SVG, JavaScript</b> and frameworks like <a href="http://d3js.org/">d3.js</a>.  Web apps have the significant advantage that they can be accessed from a wide range of devices (Windows PCs, Macs, Linux boxes, phones, smart TVs, tablets etc), hence maximising the potential target audience.  If your project is successful then we can pay for a web server to take your project "live" (which would be a great project to link to from your CVs).</p>

<p>Exactly which <b>features</b> you implement will be up to you.
  Some candidate features for your consideration are listed below (and these
  really are just <em>suggestions</em>. You can implement whatever you
  want; and you certainly wouldn't be expected to
  implement <em>all</em> of these features!). Some of the feature suggestions below include questions for research:</p>

<ul>

<li>Make it easy to explore energy data by allowing users to <b>zoom and pan timeseries graphs</b> using a similar interface to Google Maps.  This is likely to involve caching data locally in the browser, pre-emptively pulling data from the server, only loading data points that will actually be plotted for the current zoom setting, smoothly animating transitions, intelligently picking x-axis tick mark positions etc. Some questions: Would users like to be able to zoom both axes or just the x-axis?  Are Google Maps key-bindings the most intuitive?  (<a href="http://mbostock.github.com/d3/talk/20111018/area-gradient.html">Here's an example of a zoomable graph built with d3.js</a>.)</li>

<li><a id="ml">Some <b>machine learning</b> problems you could try, if you fancy it (this is by no means an exhaustive list)</a>:

<ul>

<li>If you have time then try your hand at <b>disaggregating whole-house signals</b> (it's not easy!)  If you're interested then here are two papers which, in some sense, represent the "classic" approach and one of many "state of the art" approaches:

<ul>

<li><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/5.192069">Hart 1992</a> describes the pioneering work done by the "godfather" of disaggregation, George Hart.  His main algorithm might well be something that you guys could have time to implement if you're lucky (and, as an aside, re-implementing George Hart's algorithms would in itself be a really valuable contribution.  At present there are no open-source disaggregation systems; which is problematic for a wide range of reasons.  One reason is that it's currently impossible to compare the performance of today's algorithms with George Hart's algorithms.  In other words; we simply don't know if the field has progressed since the '90s or not!)</li>

<li>The second paper is <a href="http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/homes/hanj/pdf/sdm11_hkim.pdf">Kim et al 2011</a>.  Kim et al used several varieties of Hidden Markov Models to automatically learn appliance profiles.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>You could try to <b>predict a user's quarterly energy bill</b> based on their usage so far this quarter, their usage in previous quarters and other peoples' usage.</li>

<li><b>Remove seasonal trends</b> from data to reveal underlying trends in energy usage.</li>

<li>Utility companies need very <b>short-term load forecasts</b> because it can take several minutes to spin-up large power stations.  Hence you could try to predict the total load for all users half an hour into the future, possibly taking into consideration outside factors such as weather, TV schedule etc.</li>

<li><b>Recommend energy saving actions</b>.</li>

</ul>

<li>Allow the user to <b>select an area of data</b> to get statistics for
  that selection; perhaps by shift-click-dragging over the area of interest  (<a href="http://square.github.com/crossfilter/">d3.js example</a>).  Or will this over-complicate the interface?</li>

<li>Allow users to <b>annotate their graphs</b>.  E.g. a user might want to add a note at a
  specific time to mark an event such as "installed new fridge".  Create statistics for
  before and after each annotation point.  Would users actually be bothered to use this feature?</li>

<li>Switch between different units
  e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilowatt_hour">kWh</a>,
  &pound;, Joules, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_intensity">kgCO<sub>2</sub></a>. Which units do users prefer?</li>

<li>Calculate and visualise a set of useful statistics to help users understand their consumption, e.g.:

<ul>
<li>Automatically identify "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standby_power">standby power</a>" and calculate the cost associated with this. (Do users know what "standby power" is?)</li>
<li>Today's whole-house energy consumption so far and how that compares to an average day</li>
<li>Compare the current user's consumption with other peoples'
  consumption (other peoples data could be downloaded from public Cosm
  feeds and other users of your web app)</li>
<li>Trends over time (with an option to compensation for seasonal effects)</li>
<li>Visualise live energy consumption, broken down by appliance (where
  available)</li>
<li>Predict the user's next energy bill based on usage so far</li>
<li>If individual appliance data is available then you could plot, per appliance:
<ul>
<li>hours on</li>
<li>number of uses</li>
<li>kWh per day</li>
<li>kWh per use</li>
<li>kWh per year</li>
<li>Histograms of power consumption</li>
<li>Times of day and days of week the appliance is often used</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Plot co-occurrence of appliances.  <a href="https://www.zotero.org/jack_kelly/items/collectionKey/A2B7QF6C/itemKey/2C3IBBDT/q/kim">Kim <em>et al</em> 2011</a> shows a plot of co-occurrence of appliances.  And <a href="http://bost.ocks.org/mike/miserables/">here's a d3.js example</a>:<p><a href="http://bost.ocks.org/mike/miserables/"><img src="https://a248.e.akamai.net/camo.github.com/5e1e7da1bf7835505a72d4f252a0d5d69fe3bc7a/687474703a2f2f64336a732e6f72672f65782f6d6973657261626c65732e706e67"/></a></p></li>

<li>Design a way to display data spanning very long time periods (many months or years), perhaps like <a href="http://mbostock.github.com/d3/talk/20111018/calendar.html">this d3.js example</a>:<p><a href="http://mbostock.github.com/d3/talk/20111018/calendar.html"><img src="https://a248.e.akamai.net/camo.github.com/2845e402ae4712a84b85062a70a200a31147e9cc/687474703a2f2f64336a732e6f72672f65782f666c696768742d63616c656e6461722e706e67"/></a></p></li>

<li>Design an elegant way to display data from up to 30 individual appliances per home on a single page, perhaps using <a href="http://square.github.com/cubism/">Cubism.js</a> and <a href="http://vis.berkeley.edu/papers/horizon/">horizon charts</a>: <p><a href="http://square.github.com/cubism/"><img src="https://a248.e.akamai.net/camo.github.com/00558a2a383da006de3e00e6aed0a3bd861c42b6/687474703a2f2f64336a732e6f72672f65782f63756269736d2e706e67"/></a></p></li>

</ul>
</li>

<li>Allow users to share details of their consumption data on <b>social
  networking</b> sites (in the hopes that users might compete to minimise
  their consumption).  Groups could compete against each other.
  "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification">Gamification</a>".  Will users <em>want</em> to share their data?  Are they happy to share all their data or just certain statistical summaries of their data?  Perhaps users don't want others to know the detailed time series (because you could infer when someone's at home) but would be happy to share average consumption over multiple days.  Is it even meaningful to compare consumption between users (with different sized families, different houses etc)?</li>

<li><b>Import data</b> from data-sharing websites
  like <a href="https://cosm.com/">Cosm</a> (they have an <a href="https://cosm.com/docs/">API</a>), simple text files
  like <a href="https://github.com/JackKelly/domesticPowerData/blob/master/BellendenRd/currentCost/currentCostData03.dat">this</a>
  and possibly <a href="https://www.thingspeak.com/">ThingSpeak</a>
  and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RRDtool">RRDtool</a>.  You'll need to figure out how to handle missing and corrupt data.  If using Cosm then you might want to consider keeping a local copy of the user's data on your server to improve responsiveness and allow you to quickly calculate statistics on the whole dataset (it can take a while to transfer large volumes of data from Cosm).  Or talk to Cosm and see if you can integrate your system directly with theirs ;)</li>

<li>Give users the option of either using the site anonymously (they just provide the link to their data) or they can <b>sign up</b> to get access to more features, such as weekly energy reports by email</li>

<li>Build a version of your visualisation tool optimised for <b>smart phones and tablets</b>.</li>

<li>Plot <b>energy production</b>.  e.g. micro-generation at the user's house.  Local community micro-generation (e.g. <a href="http://www.solarschools.org.uk/">Solar Schools</a>).  Maybe even plot some National Grid statistics.</li>

<li>Consider accepting other forms of data (e.g. <b>gas and water smart meter readings</b>)</li>

</ul>

<h4>2) Record a dataset of power usage</h4>

<p>Intel have kindly provided funding to buy each group member
  enough <a href="https://shop.edfenergy.com/Item.aspx?id=540&CategoryID=1">wireless
    individual appliance monitors (IAMs)</a> to measure every
  appliance in your home</b>, and a home energy monitor to measure
your whole-house power usage.  We have built an
open-source <a href="https://github.com/JackKelly/rfm_edf_ecomanager">wireless
  IAM base station</a> (based on
an <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> clone called
a <a href="http://www.nanode.eu/">Nanode</a> - pictured below) and <a href="https://github.com/JackKelly/rfm_ecomanager_logger">logging software</a> which runs on a laptop or <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>.</p>

<img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8295/7944346618_21c5ff399c_z.jpg"/>

<p>This dataset will provide a rich set of test data for your data visualisation tool, and will also provide much-needed raw data for the community's research into smart meter disaggregation.  And, if you use your own project on a daily basis then you'll inevitably generate lots of great ideas for features, as well as learn lots about the energy consumption of your appliances.  Of course, if any group member does not want data from their home to be recorded then this aspect of the project is by no means obligatory!</p>

<h3>Users</h3>

<p>There is great potential to create a product which will not only gain you a great MSc mark but might also be <em>used</em> by lots of people!</p>

<p>Potential users for the visualisation tool include:</p>

<ul>
<li>anyone with an energy monitor (some of whom may know very little
  about energy issues and will want simple but informative stats; they may not want time series plots)</li>
<li>"energy geeks" (who know lots and will want detailed stats)</li>
<li>energy and disaggregation researchers</li>
</ul>

<p>Deciding which users to target will be your choice.  If you plan to target a range of users then figuring out how to alter the user experience to match the user's level of geekyness will be an interesting question.  Perhaps you could have an "advanced" mode?  Or allow users to drill down to more detail if they desire?  Or build visualisations which are so intuitive that even novice users can quickly understand the most complex information your system can present (and hence you don't need to worry about separate "geekness" settings)?</p>

<p>There is some existing research looking at how to convey energy data to users.  For example, some research suggests that "smiley / surprised faces" are a good way to express "low / high" energy use (<a href="https://www.alertme.com/try_the_demo">e.g.</a>).  It might be fun to do some of your own research into this. Perhaps advanced users find smiley faces patronising and annoying whilst novices find them genuinely useful? Or does everyone find them useful?</p>

<p>Both the data visualisation tool and the dataset will hopefully be
  warmly received by the community.  It may be fun to present your data visualisation
  tool at the monthly <a href="http://www.meetup.com/iotlondon/">Cosm
    Internet of Things London Meetup</a> (which is very well attended and
  beer-fuelled) and there may even be scope
  to produce a workshop paper from your dataset.  If you're eager to
  work with industry then by all means consider contacting an organisation
  like <a href="https://cosm.com/">Cosm</a>, <a href="http://www.carbonculture.net">Carbon
  Culture</a>, <a href="http://open.sen.se">open.sen.se</a> or <a href="http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/">Open Energy Monitor</a> etc. to see if they'd be interested in working with you (and we'll do our best to put you in contact).</p>

<h3>Software engineering practice</h3>

<p>There is plenty of scope in this project to get involved with a wide range of
  software engineering techniques, should you wish.  For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>If your interests lie
  in building beautiful user experiences then perhaps we can attempt
  to mimic
  professional <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability_testing">usability
  testing</a>
  using <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjha0nKbwnk">eye-tracking
  tools</a> and such like (if you think that might be useful and
  fun).</li>

<li>We can help put you in touch with potential user groups so you can
  conduct user surveys to collect requirements and test prototypes.</li>

<li>There's scope to work with industry on a fairly "hot topic".</li>

<li>If you want then 
  develop "out in the open" using a service like <a href="http://www.github.com">github</a> (github have an integrated wiki and issue tracker, both of which can be very useful on group projects).</li>
</ul>

Some fascinating responses.  And I also <a href="http://jack-kelly.com/group_msc_project_on_visualisation_and_analysis_of_domestic">posted to my blog, which is also attracting some really useful responses</a>.</li>

<li>On 29<sup>th</sup> Nov 2012, the UK's government announced a consultation on energy efficiency. To quote <a href="http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/opinion/2228193/uk-must-reap-huge-benefits-of-demand-reduction">Ed Davey, Secretary of State For Energy and Climate Change</a>: 

<blockquote><em>...today we will launch a consultation on how further electricity savings can be secured. Our proposals complement existing policies like the Green Deal and signal our clear commitment to reducing demand by encouraging and supporting greater efficiency in the way we use electricity.<br/>

The benefits are hugely significant. A 10 per cent reduction in electricity demand could lead to cost savings of around &pound;4bn in 2030, more than compensating for the investment made upfront. The amount of electricity saved is comparable to that generated by five power stations. Cutting the amount of electricity used in Britain's homes, businesses and industry can be much cheaper than paying firms to supply it.<br/>

We are putting forward a range of options - some that are economy wide, others which are more targeted. One idea is to reward the energy saved by households and businesses who make efficiency improvements. Another is to offer targeted financial incentives for replacing older technologies with new more efficient equipment. We are also proposing a scheme to support the installation of efficient control systems for lighting or air conditioning...</em></blockquote></li>

<li>Some psychology / design research:
<ul>

<li>The <a href="http://www.projectcharm.info/">CHARM project</a> may well be relevant.  To quote their website: "<em>CHARM, funded by the RCUK Digital Economy Programme, employs digital technologies as a means of providing individuals with feedback about their own and others' sustainability behaviours. Thus, the three-year project examines the potential for telling people what other people do - the so-called 'social norm' approach - to change individual practices and behaviours in socially-desirable ways... This approach has been successfully employed in the contexts of alcohol and substance abuse, and sustainability issues such as electricity consumption, recycling and hotel towel reuse.</em>". There are <a href="http://www.projectcharm.info/papers/">a handful of papers listed on the CHARM website</a>.</li>

<li><a href="http://architectures.danlockton.co.uk/dan-lockton/">Dan Lockton</a> (a researcher at WMG, University of Warwick, and at Brunel University in London, specialising in design for behaviour change for social and environmental benefit) has also done some work on recommendations.  For example, he produced this mock-up image (taken from an interesting 2009 blog post on "<a href="http://architectures.danlockton.co.uk/2009/06/18/smart-meters-some-thoughts-from-a-design-point-of-view/">Smart Meters: some thoughts from a design point of view</a>"): <img src="http://danlockton.co.uk/research/images/smartmeteroptions_no3_600px.jpg"/> Dan Lockton is involved in a &pound;580K research project at Brunel "<em>to unearth how good design can cut energy use</em>" called <a href="http://www.brunel.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/news-items/ne_30411">EMPOWER</a> which may also be of interest.  EMPOWER "<em>aims to reduce workplace energy use through connecting people with energy and behavioural data in engaging ways.</em>" </li>
