That statement seems somewhat at odds to the evidence:

Multiple independent global Surface Temp measurments show \~0.8 degree
rise since 1900 to now.

\* The NASA GISS Global Land-Ocean Temp Index shows \~0.8 degree warming
since 1900 http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs/Fig.A2.lrg.gif

\* NOAA

\* JMA http://ds.data.jma.go.jp/tcc/tcc/products/gwp/temp/ann\_wld.html

Northern Hemisphere Sea Ice Extent has been decreasing at -5.9 (+/-
2.0)% per decade since 1980

Total glacier mass has decreased:

Sea level is rising at 3.2 +/- 0.4 mm per year (largely due to thermal
expansion): http://sealevel.colorado.edu/

There's plenty more evidence if you want it...

Er.  Yes you do.  Excuse me if I don't subscribe to your beliefs without
being presented with evidence.

Personally, I have read the context behind many of the CRU emails and I
believe that most of the CRU emails become distinctly benign if you read
them in their intended context.  But I suspect that you'll never be
convinced that the CRU emails show anything other than conspiracy, fraud
and collusion.  Fine.  Chuck out every report the CRU have ever done.
 Likewise with any paper Mann has ever written or co-authored.  You're
still left with a huge quantity of evidence.  The CRU form only a small
part of the climate science community.  My "demented conclusions" are
based on a far wider body of evidence than just the output of the CRU.
