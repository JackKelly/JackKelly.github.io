How to edit DVCProHD in Premiere Pro? Several options:

-   Serious Magic DV Rack HD (Serious Magic was bought by Adobe and DV
    Rack will be included with Premiere Pro CS3 and
    re-badged "OnLocation". Not sure if OnLocation will support
    DVCProHD - [here's a thread on The
    Cow](http://forums.creativecow.net/readpost/3/873191?univpostid=873191&pview=t)).
-   Cineform Aspect / Prospect HD
-   [RayLight](http://www.dvfilm.com/raylight/)
-   Ingest as uncompressed onto AJA HD card.
