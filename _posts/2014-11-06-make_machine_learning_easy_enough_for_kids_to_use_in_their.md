The aim of this project is to make sophisticated machine learning tools
so easy to use that kids (and adults with little knowledge of computer
science) can use machine learning algorithms in their creations. The
approach is to wrap machine learning tools as simple ‘building blocks’
which can be bolted together with existing rapid prototyping tools to
allow users to quickly throw together sophisticated inventions. e.g.
Lego robots which can classify objects using a video camera, or can
understand natural speech, or learn some task through trial and error
(e.g. balancing on one leg). [Full (draft) spec
