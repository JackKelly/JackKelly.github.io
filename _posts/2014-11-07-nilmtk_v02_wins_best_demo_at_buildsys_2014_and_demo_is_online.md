[Oli Parson](http://www.oliverparson.co.uk) and [Nipun
Batra](http://nipunbatra.github.io) (my two awesome collaborators on the
core of our [open source energy disaggregation framework
NILMTK](http://nilmtk.github.io)) have just attended [BuildSys
2014](http://www.buildsys.org/2014/) in Memphis. Oli presented NILMTK
v0.2 as a demo and it won best demo! Hurray! Well done Oli for doing an
excellent presentation. The demo is an [IPython
notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) and is available to view
online: [NILMTK v0.2 BuildSys
demo](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/nilmtk/nilmtk/blob/master/notebooks/BuildSys_2014_demo.ipynb).
Also, you can read more about [energy disaggregation at BuildSys on
Oli's
blog](http://blog.oliverparson.co.uk/2014/11/energy-disaggregation-at-buildsys-2014.html).
