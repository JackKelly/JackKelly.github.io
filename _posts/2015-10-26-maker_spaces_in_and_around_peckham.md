There are (at least) two new "Maker Spaces" in or near to Peckham...

In Peckham's Bussey Building there is the new [Hub
Workshop](http://www.hubworkshop.com) which opened in 2015, I think.
They have a laser cutter, 3D printer, CNC router and some other cool
things. Very excited about this as it's just a 10 minute walk from my
house! Not sure they have much in the way of electronics test tools?

In Herne Hill there's the new [South London
Makerspace](http://southlondonmakerspace.org). They also have a 3D
printer, laser cutter and other tools and a bunch of electronics test
tools. They opened in 2014.

There are also a number of other cool workshops near Peckham. Take a
look at the [Open Workshop Network map](http://openworkshopnetwork.com)
