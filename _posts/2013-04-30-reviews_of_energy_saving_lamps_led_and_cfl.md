Brief reviews of some energy saving lamps we've used. <!--break-->

------------------------------------------------------------------------

MR16
====

A 12volt fitting. We have ten MR16 fittings in our kitchen ceiling and
one above our shower.

### [Philips Dimmable MASTER LED 10W MR16 GU5.3 24degrees 2700K for £22](http://www.thelightbulbshop.co.uk/Shop/LEDLightBulbs/Product/32382/MLED10WGU53/10WMASTERLEDspotLVMR16DimmableGU53.aspx)

Very impressed. Lovely quality of light; genuinely looks like a tungsten
light. Dims very well on our cheap TRIAC dimmer (I currently have it
installed in parallel with 9 50W halogens). Only 47 lumen per watt,
which isn't great. Would probably get the 36 degree version. *update
25/4/2013* We have now replaced all 10 of our kitchen halogens with
Philips 10W LEDs. I do prefer the 36 degree version. Works very well. A
few small things to be aware of:

-   Our dimmer has a push-button to turn it on and off. If the dimmer is
    in a low setting when you first turn it on then the lights will
    flash brightly and then dim, which is a little unpleasant in
    the evenings. I think I dimmer is also designed to smoothly ramp up
    the lights (which is quite a nice effect when using tungsten lights)
    but this confuses the LEDs a bit when they first turn on.
-   You can't use the full range of the dimmer. If you dim below a
    certain level (20%?) then the lights flicker. But that's fine. The
    lowest stable setting is pleasingly dim.
-   These lights do include a very small fan. I didn't notice the fan
    noise when we only had 3 lights installed in our kitchen
    during testing. With 10 LED lights, the noise is noticable when
    there is no background noise in the kitchen. I would object to this
    noise if the lights were in a room with little background
    noise (e.g. our home office) but our kitchen is generally quite
    noisy anyway (we usually have the radio on; or our daughter is
    playing etc) so the noise of the lamps genuinely doesn't bother me
    in the kitchen. To try to put this into context: with all 10 lamps,
    the sound is comparable to a quiet laptop fan.
-   Overall very impressed.

### [Philips Dimmable MASTER LED 4W MR16 24° from ledbulbs.co.uk for £18.99](http://www.ledbulbs.co.uk/products/MR16%2C+MR11+%26+AR111+Bulbs/Dimmable+MR16+LEDs/Philips+Dimmable+MASTER+LED+4W+MR16+24%C2%B0/1691868957)

Lovely quality of light; genuinely looks like a tungsten light. Not a
huge quantity of light though. Expensive! Flickers a tiny but when used
with a normal dimmer. Only dims down to about 30%. Does not flicker at
all when used with a normal (non dimmable) 12v transformer.

### Megaman Dimmable LED Reflector MR16 ER1708d-50H24D

8W, 2800K, 24 degrees, CRI=82, 400 lumen Produces a nice quality of
light. The Megaman closely mimics the design of a tungsten MR16 lamp.
Specifically: unlike the Philips LEDs, the Megaman's two LEDs are
positioned in a similar position to a tungsten filament in a tungsten
MR16 reflector lamp. The Megaman also uses a reflector, so the Megaman
produces shadows which are a closer approximation of the shadows
produced by tungsten lights. But the position of the Megaman's LEDs also
means that, at certain angles, if you look directly up at the ceiling
then your eye will catch the light directly emitted from the LED, which
is very bright and quite distracting. The Megaman also flickers a little
on our dimmer at certain dimmer settings. No fan so it's totally silent.
We're currently using this light in the single MR16 fitting above our
shower.

### [MR16 DIMMABLE 9W LED BULB WARM WHITE CREE CHIP SUPER BRIGHT £7.59](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/MR16-DIMMABLE-9W-LED-BULB-WARM-WHITE-CREE-CHIP-SUPER-BRIGHT-/170777473560?pt=UK_Light_Bulbs&hash=item27c3217218#ht_1913wt_1183) from [xclusivesuppliesuk](http://myworld.ebay.co.uk/xclusivesuppliesuk/?_trksid=p4340.l2559) on ebay

Not very impressed. Flickers when using a "normal" 12v transformer (even
when used without a dimmer). Probably needs a proper LED driver.

### [MR16 NxtGen LED Non-Dimmable (22 piece SMD 5050, 390 Lumens, 50 watts equiv.) from SimplyLED for £11.99](http://www.simplyled.co.uk/MR16-NxtGen-LED-Non-Dimmable-22-piece-SMD-5050-390-Lumens-50-watts-equiv_A11CXB.aspx?nh=0)

-   370 lumens (for the warm white) / 5 watts consumption = 74 lumens /
    watts (which is pretty good)
-   non-dimmable (at least not using a standard TRIAC dimmer)
-   Update 24/2/2012: I've now received this bulb. It is indeed
    very bright. But it has a poor CRI. Skin looks distinctly ghostly
    when illuminated by this lamp. Overall it produces quite an "ery"
    light, even when warmed up with orange lighting gel
    ([CTO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_correction#Gel_nomenclature) 1/4).

### [Philips MASTER Glow LEDBulb MV 470lm, 8W, 2700K, dimmable screw or bayonette](http://www.thelightbulbshop.co.uk/Shop/GLSLEDBulbs/Product/30945/MLEDBulb/MASTERGlowLEDBulb.aspx)

Very impressed. Nice and warm, natural light. Dims very smoothly, no
flicker even at minimum dim setting. Not a huge quantity of light
though. We're using this light for our daughter's bedroom pendant and
reading light. It just about produces enough light for the pendant light
but we won't use this lamp in our master bedroom because it doesn't
produce enough light to fill the room.

### [Groove Bulb 9W LED](http://groovebulb.com/our-products/our-9w-led-bulb/)

The good:

-   Good price
    ([£15.95](http://groovebulb.com/shop/led-lightbulbs/9w-dimmable-led-lightbulb.html))
-   High CRI (90)
-   54 lumens per watt
-   Dimmable
-   Lovely packaging(!)
-   British company

The bad:

-   Cold light (the website doesn't quote a colour temperature but it
    feels like it's about 4000-5000K). We tried the Groove Bulb in our
    bedroom for a few days but we really miss the lovely, warm glow an
    incandescent produces when dimmed down. So we aren't using the
    Groove Bulb at the moment, which is real shame because there's a lot
    to like about the company.
-   I suspect the Groove Bulb flickers at 50 or 100Hz. If the room is
    lit only with a Groove Bulb and if you move your hand quickly then
    you can see the "multiple still images" effect you'd expect from a
    50 or 100Hz light source. I find this a little distracting even in a
    domestic setting, and something I really didn't expect from a
    modern bulb. Probably best not to use this bulb anywhere you have
    fast-moving machinery like a saw. Even our fluorescent bulbs have
    high frequency ballasts.

### [12W DIMMABLE CREE BAYONET CAP LED 240V BULB HOME WARM](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/290866812419?var=590106689376&ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1439.l2649)

Dims well and produces lots of light. But the light is rather "ghostly"
which I would suspect is indicative of a low CRI. We aren't using this
light at present.

Compact Fluorescent
-------------------

### Tesco, 8 watt, 470 lumen, "mini spiral" E14, 2700 Kelvin

Starts producing light instantly but does take about 30-60 seconds to
get fully up to speed. Decent quality of light once it has warmed up.
We're using this in our bathroom.

### Ikea, 15W, 820 lumen, spiral, dimmable, model ES0810S15

Not very impressed. Flickers when dimmed. Produces a very cold light
when dimmed. Died after a few months. Replaced with the vastly superior
Philips MASTER Glow LEDBulb MV.
