 I'm in the middle of renovating our living room:

We're insulating the external walls and floor and making it as airtight
as possible.  Airtight construction is good for minimising heat losses
but not so good for breathing.  So we bought a mechanical ventilation
with heat recovery unit which pulls warm, stale air out of the room and
sucks in fresh air.  It transfers 85% of the heat from the warm exhaust
air to the incoming fresh air.  So you get fresh air without wasting too
much heat.

If you're interested, I've written up my MVHR research on
EnviroWiki: [envirowiki.org.uk/wiki/Mechanical\_Ventilation\_with\_Heat\_Recovery](http://envirowiki.org.uk/wiki/Mechanical_Ventilation_with_Heat_Recovery)

The unit has just arrived.  I'll install it over the next few days.
