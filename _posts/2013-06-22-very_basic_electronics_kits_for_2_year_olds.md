My 2 year old daughter appears to enjoy the very basic geeky things that
she's gotten her hands on so far.  Things like plugging headphones into
the iPad to listen to music; building things with large Lego blocks;
turning torches on and off; playing with little remote-controlled-cars
etc etc.

I'd like to see how she gets on with some sort of basic "electronics
kit" which allows her to experiment a little while teaching her some
very basic principals (like circuits require both a power source and a
load).

All existing electronics kits I've seen would be way to advanced for
her.  For example, she's years away from being able to understand what
"completing a circuit" means (i.e. any kits which require you to connect
both a negative and positive cable from power source to actuator would
be way to abstract for her).

I'm thinking of making her a very, *very* basic "electronics kit".  Each
component would be in its own little tinted, semi-transparent box. 

There would be several "**sources**" of electrical power (small battery
pack, PV cells, little hand-cranked dynamo etc).  Each source module
would have a single large DC socket to send power to another module.
Each source would produce about 3 volts and would have short-circuit
protection.

There would be several "**actuator**" modules like a lamp, motor, door
bell, volt meter, radio etc.  These modules would each have a single
*small* DC socket.

**Cables** would have a *large* DC socket on one end and a *small* DC
socket on the other.  The use of *large* DC sockets on the power source
modules and *small* DC sockets on the actuator modules should make it
mechanically impossible to create a "wrong" circuit (like connecting a
battery pack to a PV cell).

And maybe some basic "**control**" modules like a switch, light-operated
switch, oscillator etc.  Each control module would have both a small DC
socket (power input) and a large DC socket (power output to actuator).

Each class of module (actuator, controller, power source) would have its
own colour.

Does anyone know if a similar kit exist for purchase?

If not, I'll make the kit for my daughter, unless anyone has good
evidence that such a project would still be way to advanced for a 2 year
old.  Of course, I'll start with the real basics like just a battery
module, switch, light and two cables to see how she gets on with it.

If the kit is a success then we could extend it by adding "control" /
"audio" cables (maybe 3.5mm jack sockets) so we could make a simple
telephone, radio, synthesiser etc etc. (Yes, you've guessed it: this
entire project is just an excuse for me to finally get round to building
the modular analogue synth I've wanted to build since I was a kid!).

(BTW, sorry I haven't posted much about my PhD work for a while. Been
busily wrapping up my data collection work and writing a paper).
