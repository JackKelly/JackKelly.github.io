*update 5/4/2013*. Just tried a 10W Philips MASTER LEDspot MR16 LV
dimmable. Very impressed. Full review
[here](http://jack-kelly.com/reviews_of_energy_saving_lamps_led_and_cfl).
I'll probably use these 10W Philips LEDs to replace all 10 of our
kitchen halogens.

*update 25/4/2013* We have replaced all 10 of our halogens with 10W
Philips MASTER LEDspot dimmables. Impressed! Full review
[here](http://jack-kelly.com/reviews_of_energy_saving_lamps_led_and_cfl).

But I'll leave my old notes below just in case they're of use...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our kitchen is currently lit with 10 × 50 watt tungsten lamps. Yes:
that’s a total of 500 watts. Which is utterly obscene and I feel
distinctly uncomfortable just thinking about it (Why do we have such a
power-hungry lighting setup in our kitchen? We had some work done on our
bathroom last year which required the builders to replace the light
fittings in the kitchen below the bathroom; I thought the builders would
replace the lamps with the original 20 watt tungstens but no, in their
infinite wisdom they threw away my old lamps, fittings and transformer
and replaced them with 50 watt tungstens. Humph.). We want to replace
these tungstens with LEDs, hence reducing the power required to light
the kitchen by a factor of 10 or so. We have several requirements:

-   Must be dimmable down to 5% or 1% (some only dim down to 60%)
-   Must produce enough light to fill the kitchen
-   Must produce a warm, cosy light
-   Must produce a light with a high enough [colour rendering
    index](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_rendering_index) to mean
    that skin looks like skin and not like pale plastic

Dimming LEDs requires a fundamentally different approach to dimming
incandescent lamps. LEDs require a constant current at all times. The
best approach to dimming LEDs seems to be to switch them on and off very
rapidly (100,000 times a second - far too fast for your eye to perceive
a flicker).

Some manufacturers produce MR16 LEDs which do work with normal TRIAC
dimmers and transformers (the sorts of dimmers and transformers used for
tungsten lamps). I presume these LEDs must include some clever
electronics which first “decodes” the dimming signal from the normal
dimmer and then uses this signal to drive a proper LED driver. For
example, the [Philips Dimmable MASTER LED 4W MR16 24° from
ledbulbs.co.uk for
£18.99](http://www.ledbulbs.co.uk/products/MR16%2C+MR11+%26+AR111+Bulbs/Dimmable+MR16+LEDs/Philips+Dimmable+MASTER+LED+4W+MR16+24%C2%B0/1691868957)
does a reasonable job of dimming from a normal dimmer. But it’s
expensive and it flickers a little and only dims down to about 30% of
max output. This isn’t good enough: we want something that dims down to
5%.

The lamps I’ve tried include:

-   [6W Dimmable MR16 / GU5.3 12V Warm White 120° LED Bulb Super Bright
    at 310Lm from eCrater.co.uk for
    £9.41](http://www.ecrater.co.uk/p/8542038/6w-dimmable-mr16-gu53-12v)
-   [Philips Dimmable MASTER LED 4W MR16 24° from ledbulbs.co.uk for
    £18.99](http://www.ledbulbs.co.uk/products/MR16%2C+MR11+%26+AR111+Bulbs/Dimmable+MR16+LEDs/Philips+Dimmable+MASTER+LED+4W+MR16+24%C2%B0/1691868957)

    -   Lovely quality of light; genuinely looks like a tungsten light.
        Not a huge \*quantity \*of light though. Expensive! Flickers a
        tiny but when used with a normal dimmer. Only dims down to
        about 30%. Does not flicker at all when used with a normal
        (non dimmable) 12v transformer.
-   [MR16 DIMMABLE 9W LED BULB WARM WHITE CREE CHIP SUPER BRIGHT
    £7.59](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/MR16-DIMMABLE-9W-LED-BULB-WARM-WHITE-CREE-CHIP-SUPER-BRIGHT-/170777473560?pt=UK_Light_Bulbs&hash=item27c3217218#ht_1913wt_1183)

    [xclusivesuppliesuk](http://myworld.ebay.co.uk/xclusivesuppliesuk/?_trksid=p4340.l2559)
    on ebay

    -   Not very impressed. Flickers when using a “normal” 12v
        transformer (even when used without a dimmer). I’ll try it with
        a proper LED driver.
-   [MR16 NxtGen LED Non-Dimmable (22 piece SMD 5050, 390 Lumens, 50
    watts equiv.) from SimplyLED for
    £11.99](http://www.simplyled.co.uk/MR16-NxtGen-LED-Non-Dimmable-22-piece-SMD-5050-390-Lumens-50-watts-equiv_A11CXB.aspx?nh=0)

    -   370 lumens (for the warm white) / 5 watts consumption = 74
        lumens / watts (which is pretty good)
    -   I’ve bought this non-dimmable light to see if it can be dimmed
        using a dimmable LED driver
    -   **Update 24/2/2012**: I’ve now received this bulb. It is indeed
        very bright. But it has a poor CRI. Skin looks distinctly
        ghostly when illuminated by this lamp. Overall it produces quite
        an “ery” light, even when warmed up with orange lighting gel
        ([CTO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_correction#Gel_nomenclature) 1/4).

### Attempting to get dimming down to 5%

I think we need to bite the bullet and use a proper “dimmable LED
driver”, instead of using “dimmable LEDs” in conjunction with normal
TRIAC dimmers. Using “dimmable LEDs” in conjunction with a normal dimmer
is pretty ugly from an engineering perspective: the dimmer was never
meant to be used with LEDs and the LEDs must therefore each include
electronics to handle the LED dimming (e.g.[these TRIAC Dimmable LED
drivers made by National
Semiconductors](http://www.national.com/en/led/bulb/index.html)). It’s
better to use “dumb” LEDs in conjunction with an LED driver which can do
dimming. (There’s a good intro to dimming LEDs
[here](http://www.yourwelcome.co.uk/wordpress/?p=304)).

Some dimmers I’ve found:

-   [MR16 LED dimmable driver 180 watts, takes 240v
    input](http://www.saving-light-bulbs.co.uk/led-drivers/mr16-led-driver--dimmable?zenid=kmmupf8b52e7hg00ar3uuv4lk3).
    “Will operatre between 1 and 25 (6watt) MR16s.” Not clear how it
    works. Comes with a dimmer. £63.95 from SLB. Dims down to about 1%.

Some other dimmable LED drivers which probably aren’t appropriate for my
application:

-   [SLV 464002 - PHILIPS LED DRIVER, DIMMABLE 700MA, 30VA £40.37 from
    bigwhitelighting.com](http://www.bigwhitelighting.com/light.aspx?s=2213957&bic=464002&utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=google_shopping)
-   [Farnell do loads of LED
    drivers](http://uk.farnell.com/led-power-supplies-driver-modules)
    (not many dimmable)
-   RS do *lots* of dimmable LED drivers. Search the
    <http://uk.rs-online.com/>RS website for “led driver dimmable”
-   [MeanWell](http://www.meanwell.com/webnet/search/seriessearch.html#led)
    do lots of dimmable LED drivers.
-   mr-resistor do some interesting LED drivers (and have a 2 show rooms
    in London)
-   I think[this MeanWell dimmable LED driver 12v 60W for
    £55](http://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/external-power-supplies/7381678/)
    might be the one to go for. Dims 100-10%. I presume the LEDs must be
    put in parallel. It runs from mains (hence doesn’t require a
    separate PSU) and can be controlled either using a resistor or a
    1-10v input. So I just need to replace the wall switch with a
    vairable resistor (with mains switch) and run a control cable up to
    the ceiling space.
-   Or maybe I should use a constant current system like this [Philips
    75W
    0-10V (£95)](http://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/solid-state-lighting/7227974/)
    or[this Philips 150W
    0-10V (£100)](http://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/solid-state-lighting/7227965/).
    Both dim down to 10%. I think I need to use a constant current
    driver with

constant current LEDs.

### update 20th Feb 2012:

Oooh, I’ve just stumbled across some nice-sounding 230v GU10 LED light
fittings. Dimmable from 3-100% from a TRIAC dimmer. 8W. 60lumen/watt for
warm white. CRI &gt;83 [TC110 from
SGSLIGHT](http://www.sgslight.com/productview.asp?id=256). I’ve asked
for a sample. I found them through
[alibaba.com](http://www.alibaba.com/countrysearch/CN/dim-led-spot-3w.html)
(and there are other lamps on there which dim to 3% or less).

### update 22nd Feb 2012:

Looking for high CRI lamps. It looks like most LEDs have a CRI of aroun
60-75%, which is pretty poor. The highest CRI I’ve found it the [CREE
LRP38-10L](http://www.creeledlighting.com/Products/Lamps/LRP38-10L-25D.aspx)
which has a CRI of 92% but isn’t available in a package I can use.

I found that [RS sell lots of LED
lamps](http://uk.rs-online.com/web/c/lighting/led-lamps/) including an
[8W MR16 LED warm which lamp with a CRI of 90% (and a price of
£31!)](http://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/led-reflector-lamps/7300394/).

#### update 31st Dec 2012

-   our existing lights have a 75mm diameter cutout
-   [it would
    appear](http://www.thelightingdesignstudio.co.uk/blog/2012/04/part-l-for-lighting/)
    that building regs part L1A (for new builds) require 75% of lights
    to have an efficiency greater than or equal to 45 lumens per circuit
    watt (although I did a quick text search through L1A and L1B but
    couldn't find anything for "lumens" or "lm")
-   a little more research suggests that fitting the PSU and lamp into a
    GU10 / MR16 package is a bad solution and that it might be better to
    use a “purpose built” LED downlight. Efficiencies certainly appear
    to be better for purpose-built downlights than most GU10 /
    MR16 lamps. Some purpose built downlights:

    -   EcoLed ZEP1 very warm white (2700K). 500 Lumens from 7W = 71
        lumen / watt (pretty good). CRI=90 (excellent). Bridgelux lamps.
        Requires LED driver. 84mm cutout. Apparently available [from
        led-eco-lights.com for
        £25.33](http://www.led-eco-lights.com/interior-lighting/downlights/ecoled-zep1/)
        but the website wouldn’t let me order and no way to contact
        them! [Downlights Direct sell it for £44.64 incl
        VAT](http://www.downlightsdirect.co.uk/fire-rated-led-downlight-6w-dimmable-ip54-ecoled.html)
        and a dimmable LED driver. I have asked if they sell it without
        an LED driver.

        £38 inc VAT each. 540 lumens from 6 W = 90 lumens per watt
        (very good). No mention of CRI.
-   I liked the Philips MR16 4W LED but found that it didn’t produce
    much light so I could try the 7W version. Only 310 lumen though

Update 3rd Jan 2013 - dimmable CFLs
-----------------------------------

-   As with LEDs, it seems that GU10 CFLs are a compromise and that it's
    better to use purpose-built CFL lamp fittings. It looks like
    "proper" CFLs (where the tube and the ballast are separate units)
    are very competitive with LEDs at present, and might produce
    considerably more light per lamp.

### Lamp fittings

-   NEED TO CHECK HOW MUCH CEILING SPACE WE HAVE
-   [JCC Fireguard GY29.3 base (with ballast and lamp) for £8.95 each
    from
    eBay](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/JCC-Fireguard-JC94040-11W-40W-Down-Light-Chrome-Display-Lighting-Spotlight-60w-/290831557248?_trksid=p2047675.m1850&_trkparms=aid%3D222002%26algo%3DSIC.FIT%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D11%26meid%3D4614866305213310531%26pid%3D100011%26prg%3D1005%26rk%3D1%26sd%3D290814483553%26#payId)
-   lots of (more expensive) fittings from nationallighting

### Ballasts

-   [Tridionic PCA TC Basic Xitec II,
    11-57W](http://www.tridonic.com/com/en/products/8786.asp). switchDIM.
    Haven't been able to find any prices. Dims 10%-100%.
-   [Tridionic PCA TC ECO Xitec II, 11 – 57
    W](http://www.tridonic.com/com/en/products/8772.asp). Dims 3-100%.
    £34.09 (inc VAT) for a 2x11/13W TCD unit [from
    lampshoponline](http://www.lampshoponline.com/hf-ballasts-dimmable/).
-   Philips do a range called "Mark 10 Powerline dimmable" which require
    a special dimmer but can be installed using existing wiring.

### Tubes

-   Lots of CFL tubes from lampspecs. Typically £2.50 inc VAT
    with CRI=82-85. 60-70 lm/W. e.g. 13 watt delivers 900 lumens.

### Possible pricing

-   10 x CFL tube at £2.50 = £25
-   5 x ballast (each ballast can run 2 tubes) = 5 x £34 = £170
-   10 x lamp holder = 10 x £10 = £100
-   push-button switch for use with switchDIM = £10
-   TOTAL = £305 inc VAT

Comparison of CFLs vs ZEP1s:
============================

-   Price (inc VAT): CFL = £305; ZEP1 = £378 (with 1 dimmable ballasts
    per ZEP1)
-   lumens per watt: About the same. ZEP1s are very slightly more
    efficient (500 lumens at 7 watts = 71 lm/W). CFLs: 60-70 lm/W
-   CRI: ZEP1s have a slightly higher CRI (CRI=90 at 2700K) whilst CFLs
    are around 82-85 (although you can get linear fluorescents with a
    CRI of 98 so the tech does exist to make flouros very high quality).
-   Ease of installation: ZEP1s win hands-down for our setup. ZEP1s will
    require a larger hole but the electronics will be very simple.
    Dimmable CFLs will require some tricky wiring, even if using a
    switchDIM system (2 CFLs per ballast, and I think 1 master ballast
    needs to drive the others). need to add ballasts myself, and wire 2
    bulbs to each ballast, and swap dimmer for a push-button switch
-   Total light output: CFLs have the upper hand. 13W CFLs produce 900
    lumens CFLs whilst the 7W ZEP1s produce 500 lumens. Apparently a
    typical 50W hallogen (what we have installed at present) can produce
    800-950 lumens, so there is a real worry that the ZEP1s will feel
    distinctly dim.
-   power factor: I imagine (but I don't know for sure) that dimmable
    CFLs (using external ballasts) will have a higher PF than using
    ZEP1s in conjunction with a "normal" dimmer.
-   cost to replace bulbs: CFLs bulbs are very cheap compared to
    LED bulbs. But dimmable CFL ballasts are expensive compared to
    dimmable LED ballasts!

So I think I'm slightly leaning towards dimmable CFLs. (Still need to
check if we have enough vertical ceiling void space!)

One concern is that LED tech is improving rapidly. So perhaps we should
wait another year or so before buying LEDs?
