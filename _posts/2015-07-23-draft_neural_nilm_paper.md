My [draft Neural NILM paper is available
here](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~dk3810/neuralnilm/neural_nilm.pdf), if
you're interested (this is currently submitted to a conference)

Comments are very welcome!

About to go on holiday...

*update* the paper is now or arXiv : "Neural NILM: Deep neural networks
applied to energy disaggregation" is now on
[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.06594)

*update 2*: the code isn't available yet but I definitely plan to
release it.
