My ~~draft Neural NILM paper is available
here~~, if you're interested (this is currently submitted to a conference) (update: please get the paper from [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.06594)).

Comments are very welcome!

About to go on holiday...

*update* the paper is now or arXiv : "Neural NILM: Deep neural networks
applied to energy disaggregation" is now on
[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.06594)

*update 2*: the [code is available on github](https://github.com/JackKelly/neuralnilm).
