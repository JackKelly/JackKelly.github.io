Last night, I went to [Crack Village's](http://www.crackvillage.com)
album launch party. Who are Crack Village? Well, they are two things.
Firstly, they're an excellent electro-rap-funk bank. Secondly, two of my
best friends from school (DCPS) are in the band (Pete and Druze). I took
some photos last night; [these photos are now
online](https://www.flickr.com/photos/37816297@N06/albums/72157627897730164).
