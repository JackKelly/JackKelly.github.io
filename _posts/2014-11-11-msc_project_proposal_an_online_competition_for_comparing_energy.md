A sizeable challenge in the energy disaggregation community is that of
comparing NILM algorithms from different researchers. In other words, if
we have two papers, and one paper reports an accuracy of 80%, and
another reports an accuracy of 85% then we cannot infer that the second
paper is *better* because the authors used different datasets, different
pre-processing etc. Hence we are working on a project proposal for the
consideration of Imperial Computer Science MSc students. If a group of
students selects the project then they'll work on it for the duration of
next term. [Here's the full, draft project
specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14UVX5ZxJHqcM1uRnyxenztotwy0RdNoVkYYTCah4YOA/pub).
