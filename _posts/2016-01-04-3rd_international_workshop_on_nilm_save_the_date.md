Dear NILM researchers,

The 3rd International Workshop on Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM)
will be held in **Vancouver, Canada from May 14 to 15, 2016**. The venue
for the workshop is still under consideration. Last workshop was held
June/2014 at the University of Texas, Austin, in Austin, TX.

The agenda for the NILM2016 is still being defined, but the current
proposal is to have two full-days of activities. There will be working
groups, paper presentations and a poster session. We have two confirmed
invited speakers George W. Hart and Robert Sonderegger (Itron). Website
will go live first week of January 2016 (http://nilmworkshop.org/2016/).

### WORKSHOP MISSION AND OBJECTIVES

The mission of this workshop is to create a forum that can unite all the
researchers, practitioners, and students that are working on the topic
of energy disaggregation. The main objective of this event is to review
the main types of approaches that have been explored to date to solve
the problem of electricity disaggregation, and to then discuss possible
paths forward knowing what has been tried and what has yet to be
experimented. We also intend to have a group discussion about possible
solutions to the growing need for standardized datasets and performance
metrics that can allow the field to move forward, as well as possible
areas of collaboration among different research groups.

### PAPER SUBMISSION AND AUTHOR INFORMATION

We invite all researchers working on NILM-related topics to submit
4-page papers to the conference for oral presentation or presentation
during a poster session. All submissions must use [IEEE style
files](http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html)
for LaTeX or Word. We encourage authors to submit papers on research
that is ongoing or contains recent results: as the workshop will only
include online proceedings, submission to the workshop will not prevent
any material from being submitted later to a journal or conference.

### IMPORTANT DATES

-   Paper Submission Deadline: March 15
-   Notification of Acceptance: April 10
-   Final Paper Submission Due: April 24
-   Registration Deadline: April 24

-   Registration Fee: FREE

-   Keynote Speaker: **George W. Hart**

-   Invited Speaker: **Robert Sonderegger, Itron**

We are looking forward to welcoming you to NILM 2016 in Vancouver!
