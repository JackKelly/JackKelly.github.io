My blog has been getting a lot of comment spam which has been tedious to
try to resolve. I am using several anti-spam Drupal modules and these
catch a lot of spam but about 10 spam messages were still getting
through per day. It got so bad that I completely disabled comments on my
site but this was clearly not a good solution. So I have changed the
permissions so users must log into my site before you can post comments.
You can register a new account on this site or you can log in using
Facebook, Google or Twitter (achieved using the [Drupal HybridAuth
plugin](https://www.drupal.org/project/hybridauth)). <!--break-->
