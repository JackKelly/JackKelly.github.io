I use artificial intelligence to mitigate climate change (mostly by increasing energy efficiency). I finished a post-doc at Imperial College London in 2017 and I will be starting at DeepMind's Energy team in June 2017.

Since I was a kid, I've been interested in how biological systems learn & process information; and I've been keen to replicate this in machines. I studied Neuroscience BSc at UCL & absolutely loved it.

But, towards the end of my BSc, I became increasingly worried about climate change. Back then, I couldn't see how to solve climate change using neuroscience.

I had been excited by filmmaking since my teens so it seemed natural to try to make a living making environmental films.  I had a lot of fun [working on a wide variety of films](/films); but it turned out to be almost impossible to make a living making environmental films.

So I went back to my geeky AI-inspired roots and did the Computer Science MSc at Imperial, with the explicit aim of using AI to mitigate climate change. The MSc was a huge amount of fun so I applied to do a PhD on energy disaggregation, which I also thoroughly enjoyed. After my PhD, I did a post-doc (based at Imperial but paid for by the lovely folks at EDF Energy) looking at how to help the disaggregation field evolve rapidly. 

However, the last paper I wrote during my PhD showed that there really isn't much good evidence that disaggregated energy bills encourage people to save energy. So I decided to shift my focus away from disaggregation.

So I did lots of research into how best to mitigate climate change using computer science. At points I was quite down-beat: hardly any of the options I considered had much chance of having a sizeable real-world impact. 

In late-2016, as part of my research into what to work on next, I sent an email to a researcher at DeepMind asking for his opinions on how best to mitigate climate change using computer science. I was extremely fortunate that this email exchange led to me entering the DeepMind recruitment process with the result that I landed a job on DeepMind's Energy team. I'm beyond excited to get this job because this is probably my best chance to have real-world impact on mitigating climate change using artificial intelligence!
