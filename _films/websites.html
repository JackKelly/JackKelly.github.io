<p>In the mid-2000's, I did a little bit of web design; mostly using <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a>.  None of the websites listed below are still active.  I'm just leaving this page here as an archive.</p>


<h3>UKFilm.org</h3>

<p>UKFilm.org was a collaborative effort.  <a href="http://edeverett.co.uk">Ed Everett</a> did the majority of the CSS and "look" of the site.  I initiated the project and did most of the PHP hacking.  A group of excellent writers helped pull the project together.</p>
