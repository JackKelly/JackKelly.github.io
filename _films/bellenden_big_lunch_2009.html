<p>On Sunday 19th July 2009, communities all round the UK took to the streets to share home-made food and meet the neighbours. This is a quick little video of the Bellenden Big Lunch in Peckham, South East London. It was an absolutely fantastic afternoon. I can't wait until the Big Lunch 2010! If I had it my way, we'd do this every Sunday! Many, many thanks to the organisers, the musicians and the folks who provided food.</p>

<p>Geeky details:
Shot on a Panasonic GH1 at 720p50 with the stock lens and a Nikon 17-55mm f2.8 DX. Graded in Premiere Pro CS4.1. All handheld (poorly!) Excuse the shakiness! My Fader ND filter hasn't arrived yet so the shutterspeed was uncomfortably swift.</p>

<p>I'm experimenting a bit with different online video hosting services.  I've uploaded the video to ExposureRoom, Vimeo and YouTube.  I've been pleasantly surprised by YouTube.  The video quality has improved significantly recently.</p>
