<h2>Brief</h2>
<p>Record a live dance event whilst keeping as low  a profile as possible. Make sure the film shows the clothes in as much  detail as possible.</p>

<h2>The video</h2>

<h2>Workflow</h2>
<p>Aim: Shoot, edit and finish as HD. Produce a dual-mode DVD (&ldquo;video partition&rdquo; contains an SD video; the &ldquo;data  partition&rdquo; contains a WM9-encoded HD version). Shoot on super-16mm so  we can have smooth slow-motion and so we have the latitude to capture the glistening fabrics.</p>
<h3>Camera setup:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>2 x Sony HDV cameras</li>
  <li>2 x Super 16mm Arri SR3s with 1.78:1 ground glass</li>
</ul>
<h3>Post-production</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Scan the 1000 foot of Super-16mm at 2k on <a href="http://www.midnight-transfer.co.uk">Midnight Transfer&rsquo;s</a> Spirit4k (25fps).</li>
  <li>Transfer these DPX files from Midnight Transfer to my HD workstation on LaCie 250GB hard disks (450GB of files in total)</li>
  <li>Copy the DPX files from the LaCie hard disks onto our HD workstation&rsquo;s RAID-5 array</li>
  <li>Import the DPX files into After Effects</li>
  <li>crop the 1.66:1 frames down to 1.78:1</li>
  <li>apply some basic grading (crush the blacks, warm it up a little)</li>
  <li>apply grain reduction</li>
  <li>render as a Cineform HD AVI (the render took about 20hrs on my 2.4Ghz Athlon64 with 1GB of RAM)</li>
  <li>Import all the HDV and s16mm footage into Premiere Pro 1.5.1 with Cineform Aspect HD installed</li>
  <li>Edit in Premiere Pro 1.5.1</li>
  <li>Grade in Premiere Pro</li>
  <li>Import 5.1 surround sound into Premiere Pro</li>
  <li>Encode twice: once as MPEG-2 SD and once as WM9 HD</li>
  <li>Burn onto DVD using Encore 1.5</li>
</ul>

<h2>Challenges (you mean &ldquo;problems&rdquo;, right?):</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Not  all the files DPX copied correctly onto my LaCie. Midnight Transfer were very kind and let me go back to copy the files again. I wrote a little UNIX script to supervise the copying.</li>
  <li>Our super-16mm footage looked very grainy next to the HDV footage (we shot on 500asa Fuji stock so grain was to be expected). Next time I think we&rsquo;ll shoot on Vision2 500T</li>
</ul>
