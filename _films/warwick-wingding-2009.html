<p>The warwick wingding was funded by 
Capital Community Fund Grassroots grant 
and supported by 
London Borough of Southwark</p>

<h2>Technical details</h2>
<p>Video shot on a Panasonic GH1 (PAL) at 720/50p; converted to Cineform and edited in Premiere Pro; graded using Premiere Pro. All music was recorded directly from the event's mixing desk.</p>

<p>I use a B-Hague Maxi Motion Stabiliser for some of the "steadicam" shots.  Several of the shots were also stabilised in post using SynthEyes.</p>

<p>I mostly used old, manual-focus Nikon prime lenses.  I tried using a Fader ND for some of the shots but it doesn't flare particularly elegantly.  Most of the flares I'm happiest with were shot on my 28mm f2.8 prime stopped down to about f11.</p>

<p>The grading was quite blunt.  I didn't do any power windows or anything within the frame - all the grading is simple a case of warming the image up and crushing the blacks and tinkering with the gamma.</p>
