<h1>April 2017 release</h1>

<p>This dataset records the power demand from five houses. In each
  house we record both the whole-house mains power demand every six
  seconds as well as power demand from individual appliances every six
  seconds.  In three of the five houses (houses 1, 2 and 5) we also
  record the whole-house voltage and current at 16 kHz.</p>

<p>Each release of the dataset is labelled with the month and year.
  The most recent (and probably final) release is for April 2017.
  UK-DALE now includes 4.3 years of data for house 1.</p>

<h2>Paper</h2>

<p>The following paper describes the data recording system and the
  January 2015 release of the dataset.  Please cite this paper if you
  use the dataset or the recording hardware:</p>

<h4>Small correction to the paper</h4>

<p>The paper states:</p>

<blockquote>
  The uncompressed 16 kHz 24-bit files would require 28.8 GBytes per
  day so we compress the files using the Free Lossless Audio Codec
  (FLAC) to reduce the storage requirements to &#8776; 4.8 GBytes per day.
</blockquote>

<p>In fact, the uncompressed 16 kHz 24-bit files require 8.3 GBytes per
day, <em>not</em> 28.8 GBytes per day!</p>

<h2>Brief description of the data formats available</h2>

<h3>1 second and 6 second data</h3>

<p>All five homes have whole-home power recorded every six seconds; and appliance-level data is at six second resolution.  Homes 1, 2 and 5 also have whole-home active power and apparent power at 1 second resolution.  The six-second and one-second data is stored in CSV files where the first column is the UNIX timestamp.</p>

<h3>NILMTK HDF5 version</h3>

<p>An <a href="https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/">HDF5</a> version of
the 1-second and 6-second data (for use with
  <a href="http://nilmtk.github.io/">NILMTK</a>) is <a href="http://data.ukedc.rl.ac.uk/simplebrowse/edc/efficiency/residential/EnergyConsumption/Domestic/UK-DALE-2015/UK-DALE-disaggregated/">available on the UKERC EDC</a> and via my FTP server</p>

<h3>Utility meters</h3>

<p>Gas and electricity utility meter readings for house 1 are available in two
  formats:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Astzk9pV1BPddC1UczZYdGEwQTktdHIyN194WmpxZ2c&amp;single=true&amp;gid=0&amp;range=A1%3AD999&amp;output=html">web page</a></li>

</ul>


<a name="16kHz_data"></a>
<h3>16 kHz voltage and current from homes 1, 2 and 5</h3>

<p>The complete April 2017 version of the 16kHz dataset occupies 7.6 TBytes.</p>

<p>The 16 kHz data are stored as a sequence of stereo FLAC files
  ("FLAC" stands for "Free Lossless Audio Codec").  Each FLAC file is
  about 200 MBytes.  One channel is whole-house voltage, the other is
  whole-house current.</p>

<p>The name of each FLAC file is
  the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">UNIX
  timestamp</a> at the start of the recording for that flac file.  The
  underscore in the filename should be interpreted as a decimal mark
  (i.e. it separates the integer part from the fractional part of the
  UNIX timstamp).</p>

<p>For more info about the high frequency data, please
  see <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2015.7">our paper</a>
  and the
  <a href="https://github.com/JackKelly/snd_card_power_meter">snd_card_power_meter github repository</a> (the code we
  used to record the high frequency data.)</p>

<h4>Converting from FLAC files to volts and amps</h4>

<p>First you probably want to convert from FLAC (a
  lossless audio compression) to WAV. There are many audio
  tools that can convert from FLAC to WAV.  I often
  use <a href="http://sox.sourceforge.net/">sox</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have the WAV file, you'll need to convert from the [-1,1]
  range of values in the WAV file to volts and amps.  You'll need
  the <code>calibration.cfg</code> file for the house in
  question. This file specifies an <code>amps_per_adc_step</code>
  parameter and a <code>volts_per_adc_step</code> parameter.  To
  calculate volts from the WAV files, use this
  formula: <code>volts_per_adc_step &times; number_of_ADC_steps
  &times; value_from_wav_file</code>. The
  variable <code>number_of_ADC_steps=2<sup>31</sup></code> for houses
  1 and 2 and <code>number_of_ADC_steps=2<sup>15</sup></code> for
  house 5.  Use a similar formula for amps. (The software we use for
  recording the data used 32-bit integers to capture the audio signal
  for houses 1 and 2 and 16-bit integers for house 5.  Hence, for
  houses 1 and 2, there are 2<sup>32</sup> ADC steps for the full
  range from [-1,1] and 2<sup>31</sup> ADC steps for half the range
  from [0,1] or [-1,0].)  You can safely ignore the
  '<code>phase_difference</code>' parameter and just assume that the
  measurement hardware introduces no significant phase shift.</p>

</ul>


<h3>April 2017 version from my Imperial FTP server</h3>

<p>The April 2017 version of UK-DALE is available from my Imperial FTP server.</p>

<p><strong>The Imperial FTP server will be disconnected some time in
    Summer 2017.  I have transferred the April 2017 version of UK-DALE
    to the UKERC EDC, and it will be made available on the EDC soon.
    When my FTP server is disconnected, UK-DALE will only be available
    from the UKERC EDC.</strong></p>

<p>I'd recommend using a 'proper' FTP client program to connect
  (because it will give useful error messages and be able to resume
  downloading if the network connection fails).  For example, you
  could use <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/">FileZilla</a>
  (it's free and open-source).  Or, if you're feeling lazy, you could
  try just pointing your web browser
  to <a href="ftp://achillea.doc.ic.ac.uk:55555/UK-DALE/">ftp://achillea.doc.ic.ac.uk:55555/UK-DALE/</a></p>

<p>You can establish an anonymous FTP connection using these details
(please note the unusual port!):</p>

<h3> April 2017 from the UKERC EDC </h3>

<p>At the time of writing (June 22, 2017), the UKERC EDC are still transferring the April 2017 data to the EDC.  The data that has been transferred (is visible on the EDC)[http://data.ukedc.rl.ac.uk/simplebrowse/edc/efficiency/residential/EnergyConsumption/Domestic/UK-DALE-2017].</p>

<h2>Change log</h2>

<h3>April 2017 release</h3>

<ul>
  <li>House 1 now includes 4.3 years of data (starting on 09/11/2012
  22:28:15 GMT and ending on 26/04/2017 18:35:53 BST).</li>
  <li>The FLAC files have been moved into a directory structure of
  the form <code>house_1/2015/wk04</code> This change is required to
    match the directory structure used by the UKERC EDC.</li>
  <li>BUG FIX: In previous versions of UK-DALE, the directory storing
  16 kHz FLAC files for house_5 incorrectly had some FLAC files which
  were actually recorded from house_1.  These files were recorded from
  house_1 during 2015, weeks 34-41.  These files have been moved to
  the house_1 directory, where they belong!</li>
  <li>BUG FIX: In previous versions, the directory storing 16 kHz FLAC
  files for house_5 contained five WAV files.  These have now been
  converted to FLAC.  However, these five files are almost certainly
  too short.  These files are listed in
    house_5/KNOWN_BAD_FILES.txt</li>
  <li>The ZIP file in previous versions contained some cruft that
  wasn't required.  For example, it contained a
  file <code>building1/channel_54.dat</code> which should be ignored.
  The new ZIP file is nice and clean!</li>
</ul>


<h3>May 2016 release</h3>

<ul>
  <li>House 1 now includes 3.5 years of data (starting on 09/11/2012
    22:28:15 GMT and ending on 13/05/2016 12:11:37 BST).</li>
</ul>

<h3>August 2015 release</h3>

<ul>
  <li>House 1's FLAC files and 6-second files have been updated to
  17th August 2015.  So there are now 2.5 years of data for house
    1!</li>
  <li>The fridges, kettles, washing machines, microwaves and dish
  washers now have some additional metadata: on_power_threshold,
  max_power, min_on_duration and min_off_duration.  This metadata
  helps NILMTK's Electric.get_activations() function to extract
  individual appliance activations.</li>
</ul>

<h3>January 2015 release</h3>

<ul>
<li>We now have five homes in the dataset (up from four in the last release).</li>
<li>We have 16 kHz recordings of mains voltage and current from houses
  1, 2 and 5.  This data is available for download over FTP.  In
  total, we now have 6 TBytes of data (that's compressed)!</li>
<li>House 1 has 655 days of recordings and 54 meters installed</li>
<li>The new revision of the paper includes lots of plots describing
  the data (most plots produced with <a href="http://nilmtk.github.io/">NILMTK</a>.  And <a href="https://github.com/JackKelly/ukdale_plots">here are the scripts to produce the plots in the paper</a>).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/JackKelly/UK-DALE_metadata">The
metadata</a> has been updated to include some more information about
each house (number of occupants, year the house was built etc).</li>
<li>The 'ragged' third column in the IAM <code>.dat</code> files recording button
  press data has been moved to <code>channel_X_button_press.dat</code>
  files.  So none of the <code>.dat</code> files have ragged columns any more.
  This should make the data easier to load.</li>
</ul>
